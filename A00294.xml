            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thus in our lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of wronges and euill behauiour, is conuiction; And in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion a Recantation. But without ſome high commaundinge cauſe how shall wee finde ſuch enforceinge and forced wittnes? Balaam his Aſſe ſpake not of himſelfe, nor Cayphas of himſelfe did propheſye. And in English Proteſtant Religion, where euery one is made a Iudge ouer all, that will gayne ſay him in their conceipts, no man will ſuppoſe, or once Imagine that any one will bee fownde amonge them, to giue ſentence againſt themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, whome they value and eſteeme at ſo high a rate aboue all the world beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, eſpecially for the church of Rome, which they hate and perſecute ſo much.

                  <hi>There is no parte of heauenly doctrine more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in this dayes of ſo many intricate controuerſies of Religion, then diligently to ſearche out, which amonge all the ſocities of men in the worlde, is that bleſſed companie of holy ones, that houſthold of faithe, that ſpouſe of Chriſt, and Church of the liueing God, which is the piller and grownde of truthe: That ſee they may embrace her communion, followe her dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and reſt in her Iudgment.</hi> Hitherto the wordes of this Proteſtant Doctor, by which is euidently concluded the moſte certayne truthe of thoſe two Propoſitions in the Argument before; But to auoyde all friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous obiections and diſtinctions of theſe men, concerninge the Church generall, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phant, militant &amp;c. Hee playnely affirmeth, that this ſupreame and infallible iudge is the preſent militant Church in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of controuerſies: as is demonſtrated by this his words: <hi>Which amonge all the ſocieties of men in the worlde, is that bleſſed companie of holy ones, &amp;c.</hi> Where his words, <hi>ſocieties of men,</hi> and, <hi>in the worlde,</hi> are manifeſt teſtimonie, that hee aſsigneth the preſent militant Church on earthe, and no other, to haue this ſupreame, and infallible, authoritie, and Iudgment, to decide controuerſies. which is alſoe proued by all the reſt of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant citations, in this chapter hereafter. And if their words were not ſo cleare that they cannot bee wreſted otherwiſe: yett the Queſtion it ſelfe doth make it manifeſt: for all the faithfull people that euer were,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:26120:8"/> and be now in many thowſands deceaſed, out of this life, cannot now be aſſembled in a Cowncell to giue ſentence. And much leſſe can they that are not yett borne, be ſo gathered together, to pronownce Iudgment: and yett all this belonge vnto, and ar, or shall bee members of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Churche. further this is conuinced by his cited words: <hi>That houſeholde of faith:</hi> which cannot bee poſſibly ment but onely of the militant Church. For in the triumphant Church, ſeeing God in himſelfe, and truely and perfectly knoweinge without beleefe all ſacred miſteries, <hi>faith,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>is euacuated</hi> in them, and turned into knowledge, and as for thoſe that ar not yett borne, though hereafter in their time or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned, they at truely to beleeue, yett now they neither haue faith nor knowledge of any thinge, nor any other qualitie or any being at all. Thirdly this is euident alſo in his laſte words: <hi>Embrace her communion, followe her directions, and reſt in her Iudgment.</hi> Which Proteſtants will not, and cannot meane of the triumphant Churche: and by no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie can either bee vnderſtoode, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refied of the true beleeuers to come here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and not yett produced into this life; for this as yett haueing no eſſence, or beeinge for themſelues, can haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, giue no directions, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nownce Iudgment for vs, now extant to embrace and followe. And this is inuincibly further proued in the Arguments follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>einge.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:26120:8"/> Therefore ſecondely I argue thus.</p>
               <p>That which hath Authoritie in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies of Religion, to define what is true, and good, to ouerrule all inferiour and particular Iudgments, and bynde all men to beleeue and embrace the definitions the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, muſt needs bee of Infallible Iudgment, and haue the ſupreame and higheſt power to commaunde, and no man to diſobey yt: But the true Churche of Chriſt is ſuch: The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore it hath Infallible Iudgment, the hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſt power on earth, and may not bee diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, but in all thinges to bee obeyed by all people. The <hi>maior</hi> propoſition is euidently true: for Authoritie is to bee obeyed by all ſubiects: otherwiſe it were not authoritie. And there were non to commaunde, non to bee obedient. And definitions in matters of faithe, as they muſt bee moſte certayne, vndoubted, and infallible, as euery article of faithe is, and of neceſſitie muſt needs bee: So they ar as firmely to bee beleeued, and profeſſed, except wee will bee Hereticks, and obſtinately incur damnation. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde propoſition is thus proued by D. <hi>Couell,</hi> who writeth of the Church in this <note place="margin">

                  <hi>neuer thought ſafe, to neglect the Iudgment of manye, and rashlie to followe the fancye and opinion of ſome fewe.</hi> Hitherto this Proteſtant doctor, directly proueinge the ſecond propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which hee is cited: which alſo is confirmed by the Arguments follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge.</p>
               <p>Thirdly I argue thus: whatſoeuer hath authoritie from Chriſt, to approue the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, to bee a ſpeciall grownde in the matter of ſcriptures, to publishe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund to her children, in Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; is the higeſt Iudge and of Infallible Iudgment: But the true Churche of Chriſt is ſuch: Therefore it is the higheſt Iudge, and infallible in Iudgment. The <hi>Maior pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> is euidently proued, and confeſſed before, and of all men cannot bee excepted againſt by Proteſtants, commonly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teing the higheſt, and (conſequently) infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Iudgement to the ſcriptures: for if they haue their allowance and Infallibilitie, ſoe much as belongeth vnto vs and our knowledge, from the authoritie and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Churche: The Church ſo giueing them allowance, and warrant of Infallibilitie, muſt needs bee as much, or more Infallible, at leaſte concerninge vs, in which maner wee diſpute, accordeinge to that Rule of Logicke, <hi>Propter quod vnumquod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tale, &amp; illud magis. That which is the cauſe why any thinge is ſo, is rather ſo it ſelf.</hi> Which is euident thus, in this caſe. For if the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo much as appertayneth to our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:26120:9"/> knowledge, haue not approbation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie of truthe, but at they at approued and published for ſuch by the Churche: This Church which ſo giueth them ſuch allowance, and warrant of Infallibilitie, muſt needs likewiſe bee infallible, which thoughe it needeth not confirmation, being iuſtified by a <hi>Maxime</hi> in the light of nature, may yett for Proteſtants bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made manifeſt by the Proteſtant Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Aſſertion:</hi> who to proue the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of England to bee no true miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <note place="margin">

               <p>The ſecond is thus proued by D. <hi>Couell,</hi> and D. <hi>Whitakers,</hi> cited and allowed by him in this words: <hi>The Church of Chriſt according to her authoritie receaued from him, hath warrant to approue the ſcriptures, to acknowledge, to receaue, to publishe and commaunde vnto her children.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Wotton witneſſeth the like in this maner. <hi>The Iugdment of the Churche, wee ar ſo far from diſcrediting, that wee holde it for a ſpeciall grounde in this matter of ſcriptures.</hi> Therefore that Iudgment which may in no wayes bee diſcredited in the greateſt matter, muſt needs bee infallible. For euery witnes that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:26120:10"/> is fallible may iuſtely bee diſcredited, in ſuch buſines eſpecially.</p>
               <p>My fourth Argument is this: whatſoeuer doth ſupport and ſuſtayne the truthe, in which, and no where els the truthe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, which is a diligent and warye keeper of Chriſts true doctrine, committed vnto it, chaungeinge nothinge at any time, diminisheinge nothinge, addinge nothinge, not loſeing her owne, nor vſurpinge things belonginge to others, muſt needs bee of Infallible Iudgment, and free from error: But the true Church of Chriſt is ſuche: Therefore it is infallible in Iudgment, and free from error. The firſt propoſitions is euidently true: for truthe once committed vnto one and continually ſo ſupported, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayned and preſerued, without chaunge, diminution, addition, loſſe or vſurpation, muſt of neceſſitie and Infallibly ſtill bee truthe: for neither truthe nor any thinge els ſo mayntayned, and kept vnuiolable, can by any poſſibilitie bee ouerthrowne or altered. The ſeconde propoſition is thus proued by this Proteſtants: M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Ormerods <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ormerod. pict. pap. pap.</hi> 93.</note> words bee thus: <hi>The Church is called a piller, becauſe it is like vnto a piller. For as a piller dothe ſupporte, and vnderproppe a buildinge, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it more ſtable firme and ſtronge: ſo the Church doth ſuſtayne, and ſupporte the truthe: for the truthe is no where preſerued but in the Churche:</hi> D. Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sutcliffe against the</hi> 3 <hi>conuerſ. pag.</hi> 79.</note> approueth this ſentence: <hi>Chriſts true Church is a diligent and wary keeper of doctrines committed to her, and chaungeth nothinge at any</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:26120:10"/> 
                  <hi>time, diminisheth nothinge, addeth nothinge ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, looſeth not her owne, nor vſurpeth things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeinge to others.</hi> Therefore Chriſts true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine committed to the true Church, and continued and preſerued longe time in the Church of Rome, Chriſts true Church (as this Proteſtants graunt in the next chapter, muſt needs ſtill be there and that ſtill the true Church of Chriſt: becauſe that euer preſerueth, and neuer looſeth, or chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the truthe, nor any part thereof, fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, or not fundamentall.</p>
               <p>Laſtely in this Queſtion I argue thus: whatſoeuer Societie, or Companie hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in controuerſies of faith, and out of it there is no ſaluation, remiſſion of ſynnes, or hope of eternall life, muſt needs bee infallible in Iugdment, free from error, and onely to be obeyed in ſuch things, aboue all other Conſiſtories, Conuenticles, or priuate parſons: But the true Church is ſuch: Therefore Infallible in Iudgment, free from error, and ſo to be obeyed. The firſt propoſition is euidently true: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe men were ſome times bownde to bee Hereticks, or beleeue errors, becauſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is to bee obeyed, and not reſiſted: and Hereticks might be ſaued, or God our moſte good and mercifull Lord and Sauiour compelleth and neceſſitateth man to bee damned, which be euident blaſphemies.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition is proued by theſe English Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: firſt their booke of

               <p>My next Argument is this: All that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the preſent Greeke Church, to be the true Church of Chriſt, and yett further acknowledg, that the Church of Rome conſenteth with the ſame Greeke Churche, except in ſome fewe things, in which they alſo holde, that the Romane Church tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the truth, and the Greekes be in Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, muſt needs acknowledge the Church of Rome, to be the true Church of Chriſt: But theſe Proteſtant writers of England doe Thus: Therefore they muſt allowe, that the Church of Rome is the true Church of Chriſt. The <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition is euidently true, for the comparatiue degree in all things includeth the poſitiue, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth an encreaſe vnto it: as better, or more good, more white, more vertuous, more true, &amp;c. do include goodnes, whitenes, vertue, truth &amp;c. and increaſeth them: Therefore that Church which is more true, then that which is affirmed to be true, muſt needs be graunted to

               <p>Thus I argue againe: That which was the true Church in the time of Luther within an hundred yeares, by the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Proteſtants, wherein as in the true Church of Chriſt, Chriſtianitie, Baptiſme, Ordination, and power of Miniſtry were receaued, and which brought forth of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Kinges and Queenes many Saincts in heauen, and many moſte learned, holy, and ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The firſt propoſition is euidently true for if (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by theſe Proteſtants <hi>there is no ſaluation out of the true Church</hi> ſo many glorious Saincts and holy ones, Kinges, Queenes, Popes, and Doctors, that could not be excuſed by

And that which is the Mother Church, which is the higheſt, if it be a part of the howſe of God, and viſible Church, and the familie of Ieſus Chriſt, it muſt needs be the moſte excellent part thereof, the heade, and cheife, and ſo abſolutely the true Church, ſuch ſocieties being named

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:26120:28"/> conſtantly perſiſteth in all things, neceſſarie and eſſentiall: ſuch as this Queſtion of the Popes prerogatiue and higheſt Iuridicall power is: for as it followeth in theſe mens Iudgments, if the Pope is not ſupreame heade, and Ruler of the true Church of Chriſt, then that ſocietie that ſo accepteth him, is not the true Church: So if it be proued, that hee is the higheſt ſupreame paſtor, and vicar of Chriſt in earthe. That Church which ſo receaueth him, and no other is the true Church of Chriſt. For to be ſupreame gouernor of the true Churche, and the true Church ſo to be gouerned, ar mutuall and vnſeparable Correlatyues, as a Kinge and Kingedome, Lord and Seruant and the like. And this with that which is entreated in the former chapter might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in this controuerſie. But to giue all contentment. I will proue it more in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and firſt argue thus.</p>
               <p>That Church which is the <hi>Mother,</hi> and conſequently, commaundeing Church ouer all Churches, her children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath ſupreame authoritie ouer them, otherwiſe no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor commaunder ouer all: But the Church of Rome is this Mother and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding Church: Therefore it hath ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame authoritie ouer all. Therefore the Pope higheſt Paſtor in it, is this ſupreame Ruler, and Commaunder. Bothe propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be proued by Proteſtants before: and ſo nothinge remayneth doubtfull.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:26120:29"/>
               <p>Further I argue in this order: No ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or companie wanteing one ſupreame, and cheefe Paſtor ouer the reſt, to ſuppreſſe Sciſmes, and auoide factions, can be the true Church of God, <hi>whoſe communion all men ar bownde to embrace, followe her directions, and reſt in her Iudgment:</hi> But all Proteſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, ſocieties, and Congregations, want this cheefe Rule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:26120:30"/> without this one ſupreame, and commaundeing paſtor, and authoritie, in the Churche of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>My next Argument is thus: whatſoeuer Regiment, Supremacie, and Gouernment of the Church, was ordayned by Chriſt in his time, and was as muche, or more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to remayne, and continue in it, for future and ſucceedeing ages, is ſtill to be allowed, and continued: But the Supreame Regiment, and commaundeing Iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of one higheſt ſpirituall Paſtor, and Gouernor is ſuch: Therefore ſtill to be allowed, and continued. The <hi>Maior</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is euidently true, for Chriſts ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance aboue all things, is to be obſerued, and notheing ſo neceſſarie to his Churche, may be without damnation omitted. The <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition is thus proued, by theſe wordes of <hi>D. Couell,</hi> that followe: <hi>Becauſe in the execution of holy things, where the parſons</hi>

                  <hi>putt in truſt are but men, diſcord, and diſorder vſually doe breake in: the wiſedome of God thought it neceſſarie, that amongſt them, whoe for their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery were equall, an Inequalitie for Order, and Superioritie to commaunde, should be graunted: that by this meanes, Order, and vnion should both be preſerued in Chriſts Church. Which of it concerne all perſons, and ages in the Churche of Chriſt, (as ſuerly it doth,) the gouernment muſt not ceaſe with the Apoſtles.</hi> where it is euident, that Chriſt amonge his Apoſtles inſtituted in one, an Authoritie and Superioritie, to commaund,

The <hi>Minor</hi> is manifeſtly true: for by D. <hi>Feild</hi> before, the other patriarchall ſees beſides <hi>Rome</hi> ar in ſciſme, and no other Church but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church</hi> was extant in the worlde, beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des them, at the time of their ſciſme, and longe after neither any other then did, or now doth clayme ſuperioritie ouer them: Therefore that alone is ſupreame: otherwiſe thoſe Churches not reſiſting ſuperioritie, cannot be in ſciſme, againſt D.

               <p>Further for my next Argument, the ſame D. Feilds hath theſe words: <hi>Sciſme is a breach of the vnitie of the Church. The vnitie of the Churche conſiſteth in three things: firſt the ſubiection of people to their lawfull Paſtors: ſecondly the connexion, and communion, which many particular Churches, and the Paſtors of them, haue amonge themſelues: thirdly in holdinge the ſame rule of faithe.</hi> This ſuppoſed, which as it confirmeth the former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for all theſe things required to the vnitie of the Churche ſo neceſſarie to be preſerued, muſt needs imply a ſupreame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorite: So it giueth matter of an other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, in this maner.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer doctrine, and power, in the Church, is ſo neceſſary, that without
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:26120:33"/> it, neyther all, nor any of theſe vnities ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely needfull, can be preſerued, is to be graunted: But one ſupreame ſpirituall commaundeing Ruler, and the doctrine thereof is ſuch: Therefore one ſupreame gouernor, and doctrine according is to be allowed. The <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition is euidently <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Relation of Relig ſupr. cap.</hi> 47.</note> true, by <hi>D. Feild</hi> and other Proteſtants, otherwiſe nothinge can be ſciſme, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge can be hereſie. The <hi>Minor</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is directly proued before, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Relator, twice allreadie cited, where hee expreſſely teacheth that without one ſuch <hi>ſupreame preeminence of Iuridiction aboue the reſt,</hi> which hee ſaith all Proteſtants want and Catholicks haue, quarrells cannot be pacified, vnitie kept, controuerſies deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and conſequently neither Sciſme, nor Hereſie condemned.</p>
               <p>Againe thus I argue: whatſoeuer the Church of Rome claymed, or exerciſed, when by Proteſtants confeſſion, is was in her <hi>Florisheing, and beſt eſtate, a Rule to all, Anker of pietie, cheife and onely Church,</hi> that it ſtill ought to enioy, and wee to graunt vnto it: But in that time, it claymed, and exerciſed ſupreamacie ouer all: Therefore it ought now to enioy it, and wee to graunt it. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident, for that which is a Rule to all, may, not be crooked, neither that which is confeſſed <hi>cheife,</hi> be made Inferior, And that the Church of Rome had thoſe eminent priuiledges, is thus proued by theſe

               </p>
               <p>My next Argument, or further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the former, is thus: That
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:26120:34"/> Church, or gouernor, that in the beſt and florishing eſtate of the Church, by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, did clayme, exerciſe, and execute, ſupreame, &amp; higheſt ſpirituall Iuriſdiction, in all knowne parts, of the worlde, <hi>Aſia, Afrike,</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> was truely ſupreame, and ſo ſtill to be accompted: But the Pope and Church of Rome was ſuch: Therefore ſupreame in authorine. The <hi>Maior</hi> is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true, for in this life no ſupreamacie can extend further, then into the whole knowne world, and all parts thereof. The <hi>ſecond propoſition</hi> is thus proued by theſe Proteſtants: and firſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> amonge the Greeke Churches, and priuiledges which they clayme: D. <hi>Couell</hi> telleth vs, that <hi>Pope</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Couell ag: thea plea of the Inn. pag.</hi> 65.</note> 
                  <hi>Victor</hi> a glorious Sainct, and Martyr, did in that beſt time, authoritatiuely take vppon him ſupreamacie ouer all <hi>Aſia,</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the Churches of it: his words be: <hi>inſeperateing all Aſia from the vnitie of the faithfull, for being diſobedient in the point and queſtion of Eaſter.</hi> And what greater ſupreamacie can be named in the Church, then to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and purt forthe of the Churche, ſo greate a part of the world? Therefore ſeeing ſuch Iuriſdiction is not, but in ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie, this ſupreamacie muſt needs be graunted to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for of all Churches of the world euen by the graunt of Proteſtants, the Greeke Church next to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath euer moſte contended for ſuperiotie, and in the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:26120:35"/> auncient cowncells, next to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is moſte priuiledged: yett here they ar by a Sainct Bishop of Rome, iuſtly excommunicated, as by their ſuperior: for as theſe Proteſtants argue in an other place: <hi>par in parem non habet authoritatem. An equall againſt an equall hath not authoritie.</hi> And Doctor <hi>Couell</hi> before hath told vs, that they were thus cenſured by the Pope of Rome, to vſe his words againe, <hi>for beinge diſobedient in the point and queſtion of Eaſter:</hi> Which makes it playne in his opinion, that the Pope of Rome was ſupreame, and had higheſt power not onely to cenſure, but to decree in matters of Religion, and bynde others vnto it, otherwiſe not to haue conformed themſelues vnto him, had not beene in theſe Greeke Churches, <hi>diſobedience,</hi> which is onely againſt authoritie, and ſuperioritie. And although S. <hi>Iraeneus</hi> diſliked this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeing, with the Aſiaticall Churches, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>

                  </label> was onely, becauſe hee thought there was not ſuch ſeueritie then to be vſed, not that hee denyed the power, and authoritie of the Pope to doe it: for of his opinion of the iuſtice of his ſupreamacie D. Sutcliffe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sucl. ſubu. pag.</hi> 57.</note> hath wittneſſed before that he ſaith: <hi>Euery Church ought to haue reſpect to the Church of Rome, for her eminent principalitie.</hi> Therefore hee thought it had ſupreamacie. For <hi>principalitie eminent</hi> ouer euery Church here mentioned, muſt needs be ſupreamacie ouer all: for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:26120:35"/> euery Church being ſubiected vnto it, none is priuiledged, from ſubiection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto it.</p>

                  <hi>Pope Victor excommunicated all Churches, both Greeke, and Latine, which differed from his Church, in the obſeruation of Eaſter.</hi> This clayme, and exerciſe of this ſupreame Iuriſdiction, was when the Church, of <hi>Rome,</hi> was <hi>a Rule to all,</hi> in the Iudgment of theſe Proteſtants: and a matter of ſo greate moment, that the doeing of it if vniuſtly, had beene moſte damnable: and yett hee liued, and dyed an holy Saint.

               <p>Before my next argument I will cite the opinion of D. <hi>Doue</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Bishoppe</hi> of <hi>Peterboroughe,</hi> in this matter, that wee may playnely ſee, where vppon Proteſtants denyeing ſo many bookes for canonicall ſcriptures, which Catholicks receaue, is grownded: his wordes be theſe: <hi>Catholicks</hi>

                  <hi>proue them to be canonicall out of S. Auguſtine: wee, that they be Apochrypha out of S. Hierome, both which Doctors are of no ſmall authoritie with the Church of Rome: And therefore in this wee differ no more from them, then S. Hierome</hi> did from <hi>S. Auguſtine.</hi> This ſuppoſed, I argue thus, from theſe Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer doctrine, was taught in the time of the primatiue Churche by a Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppe, Sainct, and Doctor of the Church in the Iudgment of Proteſtants farre the moſte Learned Doctor that euer was, or shall be in all likelyhood, excepting the Apoſtles, and this ſo conſtantly, that this ſo worthie
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:26120:56"/> a man taught it to be the Common do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Churche of Chriſt, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie is more like to be true, then that which doubtefully taught by an other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the ſame time, who bothe (as the ſame Proteſtants write) <hi>delt vnchriſtianely,</hi> and his authoritie in ſome other queſtions <hi>was not much worthe,</hi> and in this alſo recalled his opinion, or renownced it to be his meanening: But the doctrine which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks hold, concerning canonicall ſcriptures, is by the teſtimonie of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, thus much more likely to be true, and worthie to be beleeued, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion of Proteſtants: Therefore by Proteſtants it is more probable, credible, and worthie to be beleeued.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior propoſition</hi> in the proceedings of theſe Proteſtants, (by whome I diſpute in this place) is euidently true. For amonge men learned in profeſſions, the Common maxime and reaſon is, <hi>wee muſt beleeue euery one moſte cunninge in his art,</hi> and amonge men learned hee that is moſte, or more learned, is to be credited before him, that is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be his inferior in learning: And do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine conſtantly taught not onely to be the doctrine of ſuch a more or moſte lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Father, and Doctor and Sainct, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be doctrine generally of Chriſts true Churche, is of more creditt, and more worthie to be beleeued, then that which by a man ſuppoſed not ſo learned, is either

               <p>From hence I argue further: All Bookes which were <hi>approued by the Apoſtles for parts of the old teſtament, were the treaſure of the holy ghoſt and diuine Inſtrument which the Apoſtles deliuered to the Churches, which ar moſte true, and might haue reconcilement of other ſcriptures,</hi> ar to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for ſuch: But all theſe things ar ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of bookes which theſe Proteſtants deny, and by themſelues, as is cited from them before: Therefore ar to be allowed for canonicall ſcriptures, bothe propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be graunted by theſe Proteſtants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſo in this argument nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth to be proued.</p>
               <p>And againe thus I argue: whatſoeuer a generall Councell in the primatiue Church (the higheſt Rule by Proteſtants before to approue ſcriptures, and bynde all men vnto the definitions of it; receaued for ſcripture, ought to be receaued for ſuch: But more bookes then Proteſtants allowe were ſo receaued as theſe Proteſtants tell vs: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:26120:59"/> more are to be admitted. Both propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions ar here alſo graunted before by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and ſo the Argument concludeth truely againſt them.</p>
               <p>Further I argue thus: Thoſe Bookes which the Iewes before, and at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge of Chriſt, for their greateſt, or greate part dwelleing out of Iury, vſed as parts of the old teſtament, and deliuered as a canon to the Chriſtian Churches, and were Ioyned in one volume, read by them of the Latine Church, then the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged true Churche of Chriſt, and were receaued in the third Carthagenian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, which was confirmed in the ſixt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell, ar now to be receaued and allowed for canonicall ſcriptures: But thoſe bookes which Proteſtants denie and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks allowe, be ſuch: Therefore they ar to be now allowed for canonicall. The <hi>Maior propoſition</hi> is euidently true: for if the Iewes before, and at the commeing of Chriſt, the primatiue Chriſtians of that time, and their practice, the authoritie of the true Church of Chriſt, the moſte prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Church before by D. Feild, and other Proteſtants, a fomous prouinciall Councell, and the confirmation of a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, ar not to be admitted, to direct and inſtruct vs, there is no meanes left for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this caſe, theſe beinge by theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants before, the greateſt warrants, and Rules wee can haue in ſuch cauſes. The

                  <hi>ſecond propoſition</hi> is proued in this manen D. <hi>Feild</hi> haueing ſpoken, how the Hebrue Iewes had made their Hebrue canon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeing to their Iewish reckoninge of the number of their letters, (how probably I leaue to Hebritians, and may not now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate) hee concludeth thus: <hi>Theſe onely did</hi>

Theſe had written ſundry bookes in Greeke, which they made vſe of together with other parts of the old teſtament, which they had of the tranſlation of the Septuagint: But the Hebrues receaued onely the two and twentie bookes before mentioned. Hence it came, that the Iewes deliuered a double Canon of the ſcripture, to the Chriſtian Churches.</hi> Thus wee ſee that the greateſt parte of the Iewes, Proſelytes, and all our of Iurie, did <hi>add theſe bookes</hi> with the other for ſcripture, vſed them as <hi>part of the old te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, deliuered them to the Chriſtian Churches, as part of the canon</hi> of ſcripture, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue

               <p>Further I argue thus: all thoſe Bookes, which Proteſtants in their authoriſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion booke, and bookes of Honolyes,

               <p>No bookes, whoſe authoritie haue at any time beene doubted of, in the Churche, are by this Proteſtant Article to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for Canonicall ſcriptures: But all bookes that either Proteſtants, or Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks receaue for canonicall, haue in the Iudgment of theſe Proteſtants beene doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of in the Church: Therefore by theſe Proteſtants, there be no canonicall ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at all. The <hi>Maior propoſition</hi> is euidently proued, by their recited article defineing <hi>thoſe bookes canonicall of whoſe authoritie was neuer any doubt in the Churche.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition is directly proued by D. <hi>Willet</hi> who writeth <note place="margin">

And to shew the pitifull caſe of this their Proteſtant Article and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion their Proteſtant Bishop of <hi>Winceſter D.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Bilſon</hi> within my limitation writeth thus: <hi>The ſcriptures themſelues were not fully receaued in all places, no not in Euſebius time. Hee ſaith, the Epiſtle of Iames, of Iude, the ſecond of Peter, the ſeconde and third of Iohn, ar contradicted. The Epiſtle to the Hebrues was contradicted: the Churches of Syria did not receaue the ſeconde epiſtle of Peter,</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:26120:62"/> 
                  <hi>nor the ſeconde and third of Iohn, nor the Epiſtle of Iude, nor the Apocalipſe: the like might be ſaide for the Churches of Arabia. Will you hence conclude, that theſe partes of ſcripture were not Apoſtolicke, or that wee neede not receaue them now, becauſe they were formely doubted of?</hi> Therefore the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of England haue no certayne, and vndoubted ſcripture, if they will ſtand to their ſuſcribed Articles, and their owne ſubſcription. Which this Proteſtant Bishop before, ſeeing the abſurditie thereof, hath refuſed to doe. Therefore they may not (as they doe) denie thoſe other bookes which Catholicks admitt, vppon ſo greate, and higheſt warrants, before in Proteſtants Iudgment, becauſe in former tymes they haue beene doubted of, as thoſe laſte reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the teſtimonie of their <hi>Bishop,</hi> and all the reſt, as D. <hi>Willet</hi> hath wittneſſed haue beene. To theſe I might add more Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from theſe Proteſtants true Greeke Churche, and the generall Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> both allowed by ſome of theſe writers, and yet alloweing, and warranting for canonicall, all bookes receaued by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks. And other Arguments by them: but theſe ar ſufficient for this matter, at this time. And as demonſtration is made, that theſe Proteſtants either haue no true ſcriptures at all, or not the true Canon of holy ſcriptures: So it is as euident, that their Religion cannot be proued true, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible (as true Religion is) by euidences,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:26120:62"/> that in their proceedings ar doubtfull, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, or no holy canonicall ſcriptures, but by them excluded from that number, and ſacred Canon.</p>

               </p>
               <p>My next Argument is this: No tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that hath many omiſſions, many addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſometimes peruerteth the ſence, is ſenceleſſe, and ſometymes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; is a true tranſlation, or to be allowed: But the English receaued Proteſtant tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is ſuche: therefore not true, nor to be allowed.

               <p>My next Argument is this: No tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that be corrupt; not anſweareable to the truthe of the originall; are not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: cannot be defended &amp;c. euen in Proteſtants Iudgments, are to be reiected

               <p>If any man anſweareth, that theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant teſtimonies of their corrupt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and my former Arguments, againſt the validitie of deductions, and concluſions from ſo falſe, corrupted, doubtfull, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine texts, and ſentences of ſcriptures, proceed onely againſt their former tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and Religion then vſed, and ſo deduced amonge them: But now they haue a new, and better tranſlation, by his Maieſties order, and commaundement, and thus intituled: <hi>The holy Bible conteyninge the old</hi>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:26120:66"/> be true, and all the others, as they acknowledge falſe, corrupt, and worthy to be condemned, (otherwiſe they haue vnworthely condemned them.) Then as all their Religion in their doctrine was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from ſuch falſe tranſlations, They muſt needs come to a new correction, and as they haue forſaken their tranſlations for corrupt, and adulterate, from which their Religion was deduced; So they muſt now alter, chaunge and correct their Religion, or ſome Articles thereof, becauſe it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and fownded from corrupt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and deceaueinge principles.

Againe, I onely diſpute againſt their Religion, which hitherto they haue practized, not againſt any new Religion, which they will make from their new tranſlations, not knoweing yet, neither they temſelues (ſo often chaungeing) what it will pleaſe them, to be. Thirdly I muſt deale planely with them, to thinke they had done farre more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably for themſelues, and their Religion, ſtill to haue faced out their old for tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, rather then to haue giuen ſuch a dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefull to their Religion, and ſcriptures, ſo much troubled their <hi>foure and fourtie tranſlators</hi>

Veſtraque Serenitas me voluit, exercitatiſſimum omnium opus hoc arduum moliri. But the Bishops as wee call, two ways wraſtled againſt it. Firſt that their vſuall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation might continue. But your highnes, the errors being throughly knowne, thought that to be wickednes. Then they themſelues would doe it, by chuſeing of their fellowes, or rather foure and fourtie vicars of their labour.

But now ſixe yeares triall hath taught, that it is one thinge to dreame of tongues, an other to knowe them. And now they are ſaid to be at a ſtand. And would willingly giue ouer, but that the Kings authoritie requireth an end. But that your moſt learned Maieſtie may ſe what is to be hoped for, from them, leaſt the Churches be forced to buy bables for the word of God: I will in few words deleuer, that it may appeace that ſuch pore ſtudents are not to be ſuffered to leſt with the Kinge, and the flocke.</hi> Hitherto this greate linguiſts oration, his exceptions are to tedious to be recited. Onely becauſe theſe men haue ſo magnified the Hebrue text of the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in reſpect of the <hi>ſeptuaginta,</hi> and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare Latine, now this greate ſearcher of Hebrue monuments can heare onely (for hee neuer ſe either of them, <hi>of two perfect Hebrue copies of the old teſtament, in all the world, and both they be in the Iewes cuſtodye, one in Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and the other at Nehardegh in Moſopotamia.

                  </hi> That all Proteſtant expoſitions in reſpect of a bindeing and Iuridicall power are priuate, is thus proued by this Proteſtant Argument: No Interpretation or Interpreters wanteing Iuriſdiction, and authoritie, to commaunde their Interpretations, and expoſitions in matters of faith, to be beleued as ſuche, is to be accompted byndeing, and Iuridicall: But all English Proteſtant Interpretations, expoſitions, and definitions, by their owne Iudgment, want this bindeing, and commaundeing authoritie in matters of

For, propoſeing without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, which hee giueth there to Bishops,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:26120:71"/> is not Iuridicall, and coactiue.

               <p>My next Argument is this: No people, or profeſſors of Religion, freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeing, that all Rules in their Religion, though their beſt approued, and moſte publicke to be moſte reuerenced, and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, be ſubiect to error, may erre and haue erred in things belongeing to God, are erroneous, vnconſtant, variable, often recant, and correct their publicke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeings in ſuch things, can be ſaide to haue the true, and Iuridicall expoſition of ſcriptures: otherwiſe there is a lawfull and true Iuriſdiction and power to bynde them of their Religion, both to errors in things, againſt God, and miſbeleefe in this life, and to eternall damnation, the peneltie thereof in the next: But the Proteſtants of England are in this Condition, by their owne Iudgment: Therefore, they haue not the true, and Iuridicall expoſition, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of ſcriptures: The <hi>Maior</hi> is proued before, and directly by M. <hi>Wottons</hi>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:26120:76"/> Apoſtles being lawfully proued, are of this nature: Therefore to be reuerenced, embraced, and receaued. The <hi>Maior propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> is euidently true, for where there is abſolute equalitie, there is not inferioritie, but paritie, as is manifeſt in all equalities. The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proued in this maner: firſt M. Wotton ſpeakeing of ſuch, hath theſe <note place="margin">

                     </gap> they were firſt deliuered. For thus our Aduerſaries vnderſtand traditions which they diuide into diuers kindes. Firſt in reſpect of the authors, ſo makeing them of three ſortes, Diuine, Apoſtolicall, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall. Secondly, in reſpect of the matter, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, in which reſpect they make them to be of two ſortes: for either they concerne matters of fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

All theſe in their ſeuerall kindes they make equall with the words, precepts, and doctrines of Chriſt, the Apoſtles, and paſtors of the Church, left vnto vs in writeinge. Neither is there any reaſon, why they should not ſo doe, if they could proue any ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written verities. For it is not the writeing that giueth things their authoritie, but the worthe and credit of him that deliuereth them, though by worde and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely voyce onely.</hi> Thus the authoritie of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions is iuſtified by Proteſtants to be
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:26120:77"/> equall with the ſcriptures, if they can be proued. Now becauſe Proteſtants mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneinge the ſufficiencie of ſcripture for matters of faith, deny traditions of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I argue in this maner. All Articles and matters of faith are in Proteſtants Iudgment proued and deliuered to vs by tradition: Therefore ſome articles, and matters of faith, are in their Iudgment, or ſo muſt be graunted, to be deliuered by tradition: The conſequence is euident, for euery generall propoſition includeth the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. The Antecedent is thus proued by them. Whoſoeuer doe graunte thoſe things, which, by them conteyne all matters and Articles of faith to be delyuered by tradition, muſt needs allowe traditions in matters of faith: But theſe Proteſtants doe ſo: Therefore they muſt allowe ſuch tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident, for whatſoeuer conteineth all, excludeth none, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all, comprehendeth alſo ſome and the parts of that all.

The <hi>maior</hi> is D. <hi>Feild</hi> ſentence. And the <hi>Minor</hi> is before proued by theſe Proteſtants: for if the vniuerſall Church (as before by them conſented) is this veritie, not onely one Apoſtolicke Church (ſufficient for his Rule) but all did conſent vnto it, otherwiſe it could not be ſaid the doctrine of the vniuerſall Church. And of all Churches Apoſtolicke, there can be no queſtion with Proteſtants bur the Church of Rome euer taught thus; and D. Field hath told vs before, that <note place="margin">

               <p>Further I argue thus: whatſoeuer is not a perfect, and compleate Rule, and Square in matters, and queſtions of Religion, without the help, and dyrection of vnwritten tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, cannot be termed an abſolute Rule in this kinde: But the ſcripture, and written worde of God, by theſe Proteſtants is ſuch: Therefore by them no abſolute and perfect Rule in matters of faithe.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE next Queſtion is concerninge generall Councells: of what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and commaunde they are, in controuerſies of Religion; and whether the Doctrine of the preſent Churche of Rome, or that of English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, is proued, and confirmed by them, in the ſentence of theſe Proteſtants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Toucheinge their power, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding authoritie, in theſe cauſes, I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer in controuerſies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is the higheſt Iudge, the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, to redreſſe errors, hath ſoueraigne

The <hi>Maior propoſition</hi> is euidently true: for that which is ſupreame, and higheſt, cannot be Inferior vnto any: neither that which hath commaunde, and authoritie ouer all, can poſſibly be vnder the controlement, and correction of any, none being left to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior vnto it.

                     <hi>Feild l.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 202.</note> (as before is cited) alloweth this ſentence: <hi>Wee muſt reuerence and reſpect, the authoritie of all Catholicke Doctors, whoſe doctrine and writings the Church alloweth: wee muſt more regarde the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Catholicke Bishops: more then theſe, the authoritie of the Apoſtolicke Churches: amongſt them more eſpecially the Church of Rome: of a generall Councell, more then all theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, to proue that generall Councells thus allowed by theſe Proteſtants, for the higheſt, and irreuocable Iudgment, cannot by their owne doctrine, proue their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be true, and ſo conſequently no Inferior authoritie Iuſtifie their cauſe, I argue in this maner: whoſoeuer by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke decree, and conſtitution, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne generall Councelle, of error, and to be a fallible, and deceatefull Rule, in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and haue no other meanes to finde the truth, cannot pretend their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:26120:91"/> Religion to be infallibly true, as matters of faith and reuealed of God are, by ſuch teſtimonies: But the English Proteſtants are in this condition, concerninge <hi>generall Councells:</hi> Therefore their Religion neither is, nor can by their owne proceedings, be warranted and proued by them to be true. The <hi>Maior propoſition</hi> is euident: for no Iudgment erroneous, and fallible, can poſſibly make any matter, or queſtion free from error, and infallible: otherwiſe a thinge might be effected and cauſed without a cauſe. The <hi>Minor propoſition</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly proued by theſe Proteſtants, in this order: for they haue before condemned all other Rules, which they haue, of error, as their parlement, Kings Cenſure, and all priuate Interpretations, and made them ſubiect, and controleable by generall Councells, as hauing authoritie ouer all parſons: D. Feilds wordes of allowance after hee had with others graunted generall Councells to be ſupreame, bynding, and commaunding all be theſe: <hi>Wee muſt obey without ſcrupulous queſtioninge, with all modeſtie of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Feild pag.</hi> 202.</note> 
                  <hi>minde, and reuerence of bodye, with all good allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, acceptation and repoſe in the wordes of them that teach vs, vnleſſe they teach vs any thinge, which the authoritie of the higher and ſuperior controlleth.</hi> Immediately before hee had allowed the ſupreame and higheſt Iudgment to generall Councells, and the next to the Pope, and Church of Rome. Then Proteſtants tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:26120:91"/> contrarie to ſuperior, and higher authoritie in the Pope, are to be condemned by him. But notwithſtanding all this to make their cauſe deſolate, and demonſtrate, that their Religion hath no warrant of truth, and Infallibilitie, at all, Thus they write of this higheſt Rule of <hi>generall Councells,</hi> euen in their publick Articles of Religion: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Articles of Relig. art.</hi> 21.</note> 
                  <hi>generall Councells may erre, and ſometime haue erred euen in things pertayninge vnto God. Wherefore things ordeyned by them, as neceſſarie to ſaluation, haue neither ſtrength, nor authoritie, vnleſſe it may be declared, that they be taken out of holy ſcripture.</hi> Therefore how truely, or certainely ſoeuer generall Councells make decrees, and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions in matters of faith, they giue no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie to Proteſtant Religion, if in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues they should approue it, for by their cited Article, their <hi>ordination hath neither ſtrength, nor authoritie,</hi> as it is the decree of the <hi>generall Councells,</hi> but as it may be declared, by a priuate Proteſtant writer, Prince, Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Conuocation, in their conceipt to be taken out of ſcripture, and yet before they haue tolde vs, a generall Councell commaundeth all, all muſt ſubmitt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto it, and all other their Rules be erroneous, and deceatefull. Therefore by theſe Proteſtants neither generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, nor any other Rule, aſſigned by them, can by any poſſibilitie, proue their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion true.</p>
               <p>Further I argue thus: No ſocietie,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:26120:92"/> people, or profeſſors of Religion, which by their owne confeſſion, neither haue, nor by their proceedings can hereafter haue, or haue heretofore had, any generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, or meanes to aſſemble, and call it, can in reaſon pretend it for their cauſe: But the ſtate of Proteſtants by their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is ſuch: Therefore generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells cannot be pretended for them. The <hi>Maior propoſition</hi> is euidently true: for <hi>eſſe</hi> and beinge muſt needs in all things, goe before <hi>operari,</hi> and <hi>workeinge by</hi> them For as by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nothinge can be made of nothinge, ſo that which wanteth being, and is not, can produce nothinge. The <hi>Minor propoſition</hi> is likewiſe manifeſtly true, for neuer any Proteſtant, nor altogether, ſo much as clayme authoritie, or Iuriſdiction, in this matter, none amonge them pretending it further, then their owne particular tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dominions, which all vnited together (neuer like to be) are farre to shorte, and vnequall, to make a Councell generall, which they ſay excludeth none, eſpecially of the greate patriarkes of <hi>Rome, Conſtantinople, Alexandria and Antioche,</hi> not one of them being for them, but all with their whole precincts, limitts, ſubiects, and ditions againſt them, by their owne confeſſion. To this I add the Cenſure of their owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant <hi>Relator,</hi> in theſe wordes: <hi>The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Relation of Religion cap.</hi> 47.</note> 
                  <hi>are ſeuered bandes, or rather ſcattered troopes, each drawing diuers way, without any meanes to</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:26120:92"/> 
                  <hi>pacific their quarrells, to take vpp their controuerſies. No Prince with any preeminence of Iuriſdiction, aboue the reſt: no Patriarke one or more, to haue a Common ſuperintendance of care of their Churches, for correſpondencie and vnitie: no ordinary way to aſſemble a generall Councell of their part, the onely hope remayninge euer to aſſuage their contentions.</hi> And yet if they could haue meanes for ſuch a meeteing of Proteſtants, ſo few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and weake in Iuriſdiction, by their owne graunte, in regard of Catholicks, and other Chriſtian Kingdomes, and prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, different to them in Religion, this would be farre from the leaſte shewe, and name of an vniuerſall, and generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, ſuch as they allowe, to Iudge, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in this buſines. Neither can theſe men now deny the neceſſitie of generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, hauing ſo much allowed them for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame ſentencer before, and appealed to a generall Councell to be aſſembled. Neither may they compare their ſo deſolate eſtate with the primatiue Church of the firſt three hundred yeares: for themſelues haue graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, that a ſupreame, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding binding power ouer all, was not onely claymed, but lawfully and iuridically exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and executed by the Popes of Rome in thoſe times, in all partes of the Chriſtian world: and both power, and authoritie to approue, and reproue Councells, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeing vnto them by publickly receaued Canon in thoſe dayes. And herevppon I
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:26120:93"/> argue in this maner, that generall Councells are for the doctrine of the Church of Rome. Whatſoeuer Church in the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue time of Chriſtianitie, was endowed with ſuch priuiledges, that euery thinge was voide, that was done without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Bishop, and Ruler of it, and no Councell could be called, without his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, and at this preſent, hath by the graunte of Proteſtants, a common Father, aduiſer, and conductor, to end Iarrs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures, differences, to keepe Religion in vnitie by Councells, when no other Church enioyeth theſe immunities, muſt needs in all reaſon be ſayde to be warranted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by generall Councells: But the Church of Rome is by the graunte of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in this Condition: Therefore war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted, and defended by generall Councells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The firſt propoſition is euidently true: for hee that from the begynning, had theſe prerogatiues, to approue, or diſproue, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, or inualidate Councells, cannot be conceaued to haue ratified, or confirmed any thinge, againſt the immunities, and Common receaued doctrine of that Church, ſo exalted, dignified, and priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged aboue all others of the whole Chriſtian worlde, and againſt his owne ſupreame, and eminent Authoritie.</p>

                  </note> principall and cheefeſt grownde of their Religion: That <hi>as a man is iuſtified by faith, ſo this faith is that, which aſſureth him, that hee is iuſt, in grace and fauour with God, that hee cannot (at the leaſte finally or totally) fall from grace:</hi> And ſo conſequently that hee knoweth as a matter of faith, that hee is both iuſt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate: as will ſufficiently appeare in the next chapter by English Proteſtants ſynce his maieſties entrance into England, the short time which I haue limited to diſpute againſt them by themſelues; what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, abuſes, and iniquities, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:26120:108"/> hath brought into the world, will in ſome ſort appeare in this chapter, by their owne writeings: and is ſo much knowne to all men, by lamentable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that I neede not to repeate it in this place. Wherefore I will onely confute this Proteſtant opinion by the preſent English Proteſtant writers, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the Catholicke doctrine of the cited ſacred Councell, to be moſte true, and religious, in this point, euen by their ſentence.</p>
               <p>Then firſt, concerning this propoſition, I argue thus No doctrine or opinion, which is a deſperate doctrine, contrarie to diuinitie, and to the true doctrine of predeſtination, is or can be the true doctrine in this queſtion: But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinarie Proteſtant doctrine, with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednes of faith (without particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation) that a man shall be ſaued, is thus deſperate, contrarie to diuinitie and to the true doctrine of predeſtination: Therefore it neither is, nor can be the true doctrine.</p>
               <p>To deny the <hi>Maior</hi> or firſt <hi>propoſition,</hi> is blaſphemie: becauſe God, infinite, and immutable wiſedome, cannot poſſibly commaunde, or reueale for truth, any ſuch error, Therefore the firſt propoſition being euidently true, The <hi>Minor</hi> or ſecond <hi>propoſition</hi> is authoritatyuely with English Proteſtants, concluded againſt this <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinarie</hi> opinion in the publicke Proteſtant

                     </gap>ſperate doctrine, contrarie to good diuinitie, and the true doctrine of predeſtination, wherein wee should reaſon rather</hi> aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dendo, <hi>then</hi> diſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dendo, <hi>thus: I liue in obedience to God, in loue my neighbour; I followe my vocation &amp;c. Therefore I truſt that God hath elected, and predeſtinated mee to ſaluation.</hi> Hitherto the conſent of this English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Conference: from whence it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that no certanitie, much leſſe by faith, but onely a morall truſt, or hope, according to the good life of man, can be had without reuelation, that wee are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate.</p>
               <p>Secondely ſuppoſing, which with the ſcriptures all Proteſtants graunt, that without grace by Chriſt, and perſiſting in it, no man can be ſaued: I Argue thus. No man that is vncertaine, whether hee sall fall from grace, can be certaine with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanitie of faith, that hee is predeſtinate, or shall be ſaued: But without particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation all men, Proteſtants, and others, be vncertaine, whether they shall fall from grace: Therefore no man without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reuelation, is or can be certaine, hee is predeſtinate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior propoſition</hi> is certainely true.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:26120:109"/> And his Maieſtie in the ſame cited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Aſſembly, citeing the place of S. Paule before related, againſt the certainerie of predeſtination, concludeth the <hi>Minor</hi> or ſecond <hi>propoſition</hi> thus. <hi>Wee may full from grace:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conference at Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſup. pag.</hi> 30.</note> and addeth: <hi>the doctrine of predeſtination should be handled with greate diſcretion:</hi> which hee inſinuateth the Proteſtants haue not done, and ſpeaketh plainely of them in theſe words: <hi>The Inferring of the neceſsitie of ſtanding and perſiſting in grace is a deſperate preſumption.</hi> The like is taught more at lardge in other places of that conference: where it is alſo <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Confer. ſup. pag.</hi> 41. 42. 43.</note> acknowledged, <hi>that preſent Iuſtification, or iuſtice is loſte, by any mortall or greuous ſyn:</hi> which to be frequently committed by Proteſtants will appeare hereafter by their owne teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
               <p>My third Argument is this: No doctrine that is peſtilent, and ſcandalous, to all Churches, is, or can be true doctrine: But this predeſtinarie doctrine is ſuch: The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore neither is, nor can be true. The <hi>Maior</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Relation of Religion cap.</hi> 45.</note> is euident. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proued by the <hi>Proteſtant Relator</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> whoe telleth vs, that <hi>Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</hi> in <hi>Germanie will rather returne to the Church of Rome, then admitt this Proteſtant point of doctrine,</hi> which they call <hi>predeſtinarie peſtilence:</hi> and addeth, that <hi>this with ſome others</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 48.</note> 
                  <hi>of their opinions, hath exceedeingly ſcandalized all other Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My fourth Argument is this. Nothing that is not reuealed of God, can be beleeued
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:26120:110"/> with certaintie of faith, or with faith: But particular mens predeſtination is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed of God: Therefore it cannot be by faith beleeued.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>propoſition</hi> is euidently true: becauſe Gods reuelation, or to be reuealed of him is the formall obiect, or cauſe of beleefe, and true faith. The ſecond <hi>propoſition</hi> is thus proued, by D. <hi>Couell;</hi> whoe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Couell def. of Hooker pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 59.</note> of this greate queſtion, hath theſe words. <hi>A curious ſearcheing into that will, which is not reuealed, ſerueth but to breede a contempt, of that, which is reuealed vnto vs. Man deſireth rather to knowe, then to doe; nay to knowe, euen thoſe things, which doe not concerne him, rather then to doe that, for the neglect whereof, hee muſt giue an accompt. From hence cometh it to paſſe, that what the ſchooles haue curiouſly ſought out, concerning the nature of Gods will: the pulpitts, nay the ſtalls of Artificers, haue vndertaken to decide them all.</hi> And <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 62. <hi>ſup.</hi>
                  </note> proſecuteing this queſtion, hauing cited and approued the Catholicke diſtinctions of the will of God, into <hi>antecedent, conſequent, of Gods good pleaſure, and the ſigne of it: into a will abſolute, conditionall</hi> &amp;c. hee concludeth thus: <hi>God willeth all men to be ſaued. Whoe therefore that they are not it is not his decree, but their owne fault. Certainely ſaithe S. Ambroſe, hee willeth all men to be ſaued, if they will themſelues: for hee that hath giuen a lawe to all, doubtles hath excluded none.</hi> Yf any Proteſtant will anſwere, (as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wotto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> def. of Perkins pag.</hi> 467. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> many of them vnlearnedly holde.) That deduction from ſcripture, as they ſuppoſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:26120:110"/> maketh a matter of faith. I tell him with all learned dyuines, and in true diuinitie, that nothinge vncertayne, doubtfull, or fallible, can poſſibly make a matter of faith, which muſt of all aſſents in this world be moſte certaine. But euery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction from ſuch ſuppoſed ſcripture, eſpecially where neither the matter, man, his name, parſon, or any thinge of him in particular is reuealed, muſt needs be vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, doubtfull, and fallible: Therefore it cannot make a matter and concluſion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and of faith. For the concluſion, in no ſyllogiſme can be more certayne, then the premiſes, and fallible humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, from, and by which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: But according to the Rule of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, <hi>ſemper ſequitur debilioreni partem; allwayes followeth the weaker part.</hi> And the <hi>Maior</hi> is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in it ſelf before. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proued thus by Doctor <hi>Feild: priuate Interpretation</hi> (or <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Feild pag.</hi> 226. <hi>Couell def. of Hooker pag.</hi> 8.</note> deduction) <hi>bindeth not.</hi> But true faith bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all men. And D. <hi>Couell</hi> expreſſely writeth the ſame, which I haue anſwered, and in theſe words. <hi>Doctrines deryued are not the word of God.</hi> But nothing, but the word of God, written or nor written, as is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, maketh a matter of faith euen by <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Argument is framed thus: whatſoeuer is onely knowne of God, cannot be knowne, muche leſſe with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainetie of faith by particular men: But par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:26120:111"/> mens predeſtination is onely knowne to God: Therefore not to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men, much leſſe with certanitie of faith. The <hi>Maior propoſition</hi> is euidently true, the worde <hi>onely,</hi> being <hi>excluſiue,</hi> and denying all others. The Minor propoſition is thus teſtified, by D. <hi>Couell</hi> in expreſſe words. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Couell def. of Hooker pag.</hi> 63. <hi>and pag.</hi> 108.</note> 
                  <hi>God onely knoweth who are predeſtinate.</hi> And in an other place, thus: <hi>Mens predeſtination vnto life none can knowe, but God onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixt Argument is: No doctrine that draweth from conſideration, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth mans ſaluation, and bringeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of good works, is true: But this predeſtinarie opinion is ſuch: Therefore not true.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is euidently true, euen in the doctrine of English Proteſtants, making in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Artic.</hi> 12.</note> their ſquare it ſelf of their Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good workes to be neceſſarie to ſaluation, and the conſideration of it alſo. The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proued by D. <hi>Couell. If all men rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Couell def. of Hooker pag.</hi> 107. 108.</note> 
                  <hi>in thoſe actions, that concerne mans ſaluation, how farre wee are tyed, not onely in obedience, but for vſe, to thoſe things that are meanes to effect the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me: few would haue beene ſo carleſſely reſolute, to contemne good workes, through an opinion of eternall election.</hi> By which ſentence hee doth not onelie denie the Proteſtant certanitie, and ſecuritie of predeſtination, but plainely teacheth, that <hi>good workes are the meanes to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſaluation.</hi> Then as the end cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayed, without the meanes, that bringeth
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:26120:111"/> vnto it: ſo it cannot be predeſtinate without ſuch meanes, except God could, or should predeſtinate things to be, otherwiſe then they be, or can be, which is vnpoſſible.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth and laſt Argument in this queſtion, may bee this. Noe man Ignorant of that whereuppon predeſtination, or the certaine knowledg thereof dependeth, can certainely know himſelf to bee predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: But all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are ignorant of that; which is, whether they shall lyue and dye in good workes: Therefore noe <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is certaine of ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident: And the <hi>Minor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Couell. ſup. pag.</hi> 108,</note> by the ſame Proteſtant Doctor in theſe wordes: <hi>Eternall election includeth a ſubordination of means; without which wee are not actually brought to enioy what God ſecretly did intend: and therefore to builde vppon Gods election, yf wee keepe not our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the wayes, which hee hath appointed for mee to walke in, is but a falſe deceauing vanitie: for all men notwitſtanding their preordination vnto life (which none can knowe but God onely) are in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yf a man is, or may be ſuer, that hee is iuſt or inſtified, and certaynely in grace, and cannot totally or finally fall away, hee is alſoe and may be ſuer that hee is predeſtinate: Becauſe noe man perſeuering and dyeing in grace, is or poſſibly can be damned: But noe man (as is proued by Proteſtants in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) without particular reuelation, is or can be certayne, that hee is predeſtinate: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither is, or can be ſo certaine of his Iuſtification, and perſeuerance, yf hee were Iuſt, and could be ſoe aſſured of yt.</p>
               <p>Secondly the ſame doctrine of the not certaintie of Iuſtification is confirmed and proued by Proteſtants, in their recited Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Confer. ſup. pag.</hi> 29. 30. <hi>Articul.</hi> 17.</note> alleadging from their booke of Articles, that <hi>the promiſes of God in ſcripture tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching theſe things are generall.</hi> From which I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus: noe promiſe of God in generall doth make a reuelation particular to any priuate parſon: But all promiſes of him, of theſe things, are onely generall: Therefore they can make noe reuelation in particular, or cauſe ſuch faith of any priuate parſon. Bothe propoſitions are proued before, and are euidently true: For noe priuate man by his humane deduction vncertaine. And ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to error, can poſſibly apply generall things vnto himſelf, with ſuch aſſurednes, and vnfallible certainetie, as is, and of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſicie muſt be in faith, founded vppon the immediate Reuelation and word of God,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:26120:113"/> which by noe power can be vncertaine or doubtfull. For as theſe Proteſtant writers haue aſſured vs before: <hi>Priuate Interpretation or</hi>

               <p>Againe theſe Proteſtants that aſcribe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſication to their ſuppoſed aſſureing faith, doe alſo teache, that <hi>ſuch faith and good workes</hi>

The <hi>Maior</hi> is

And yet it is the Proteſtant cleargie which cheefely and principally patronizeth and defendeth that doctrine of onely faith aſſureing to Iuſtifie, and the others but as taught and inſtructed by them. Further, thoſe Proteſtants that write againſt the puritans, as D. Bilſon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Bishop of Wincheſter, D. Couell, D. Sutcliffe, M. Ormerode, M. Powell, M.

Of the more then irreligeous and prophane behauiour of their cleargie of English Proteſtants, in abuſeing, falſefieing, &amp; peruertinge the holy Scriptures, Fathers, Councels, and all Authorities for Religion, I haue for this point ſufficiently entreated before, to proue that they are not iuſt, or righteous, but moſt vniuſt and impious by their owne teſtimonie. What other ſyns they are defiled with, let their owne liues and the world cenſure: But ſuer I am they are not voide of all greuous ſinnes, which they muſt be, if they be iuſtified and in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: and ſuch they muſt be in deed, before they knowe themſelues to be ſuch, except they can know that to be, which is not, as
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:26120:115"/> their sharp wits would ſeeme to doe in this and other queſtions of Religion.</p>
               <p>Then ſeeing it is to apparant, that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are not iuſt, either by their Imagined aſſureinge faith, or howſoeuer: let vs further examine by theſe writers, and Proteſtant profeſſors, whether it is in it ſelf poſſible, that this ſuppoſed faith should Iuſtifie. The contrary whereof thus I demonſtrate from their owne writings. All men that pretend to be iuſtified by this Imagined faith, muſt needs be iuſtified by ſome act or acts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: But no man is Iuſtified by any act or acts thereof: Therefore no man is iuſtified by it. The <hi>Maior</hi> is manifeſt. The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Proteſtants. Firſt D. Feild with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Feild pag.</hi> 177.</note> others doth, and of neceſſitie muſt affirme, that in this buſines of their fantaſied Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, their deuiſed faith hath twoe, and onely twoe acts: <hi>One going before iuſtification, teaching vs to pray, entreate God, and humble our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,</hi> when wee are not iuſt: and this act as hee acknowledgeth it to goe before Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſo hee thus freely confeſſeth, <hi>that it doth not iustifie.</hi> The ſecond Act, as hee telleth vs, doth followe Iuſtification, and ſo by no poſſibilitie (becauſe the cauſe cannot be after the effect cauſed by it) that is able to iuſtifie: wherefore his owne words of this Act of their inuented faith, be theſe: <hi>Shee doth not actiuely Iustifie, but findeth the thinge done.</hi> Therefore ſeeing they teach, there be but two acts in their new faith, the firſt, and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:26120:115"/> ſecond te laſte which admitt no more, and neither the one nor other, nor both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (becauſe they graunt there is no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall influence or cooperation from them, to that purpoſe) dothe, doe, or can iuſtifie, there is no poſſibilitie of Iuſtification by ſuch idle faithe, for ſo two contradictoryes should be true: man is iuſtified by ſome act of faith: man is not iuſtified by any act of faith. Which in Logicke and nature is knowne to be vnpoſſible, and a ſtupide ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie to affirme it. This matter is further proued by D. Couell: who reiecting Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">

Then Iuſtification cannot poſſibly be by onely faith, which in an other treatiſe hee declareth by example in theſe words: <hi>Faith is the fowndation of ſpirituall buylding of Gods howſe, charitie the Roofe, without which the beſt are,</hi>

                  <hi>but as howſes vncouered, that cannot longe continue.</hi> Then iuſtification which is the Roofe of our ſpirituall buildinge in this world, is and muſts needs be the worke and buildinge of charitie, and not of faith alone. Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratiuely is true by his graunt, that faith, and the works of charitie may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated: for they conſent that without ſuch works man is not iuſtified, therefore not poſſibly by this their Poeticall faith.</p>

From which graunts thus I argue. No doctrine or opinion, that is a thinge moſte horrible, vnworthie any Chriſtian, againſt the lawe of God, and light of nature, is, or can poſſibly be true: But the paradoxe of Proteſtants, that this their ſuppoſed onely faith doth iuſtifie is ſuch: Therefore it neither is, or can be true. The Maior is euidently true, and to affirme the contrary is to denie all true Religion, and the Authoritie of God: for yf hee should, or could teach, or reueale to men to followe doctrine that is horrible, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie a Chriſtian, againſt his owne lawe, and naturall light, ſuch doctrine could not
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:26120:116"/> be true, nor hee honored as God, but to be accoumpted a deceauer and ſeducer. The <hi>Minor</hi> or ſecond propoſition be the expreſſe words of the Greeke Church, ſo true, to be obeyd and followed in doctrine by theſe Proteſtants as before is cited. For <hi>Hiere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias</hi> Patriarke of Conſtantinople cheef in <note place="margin">

               <p>Moreouer I argue thus: Nothing which cannot be defended without graunting and mayntayninge, more new and ſtraunge abſurdities, and impoſſibilities, is or can be true doctrine: But this Proteſtant aſſertion, of their onely aſſuring faithe iuſtifying is ſuch: therefore it neither is, nor can be true. The firſt propoſition is euidently true, for euery truthe may, and is defended without any abſurditie, or inconuenience: The ſeconde propoſition is alſo manifeſtly

If it goeth before this their faith, then that faith iuſtifieth not, becauſe man is made iuſt before any Act of that applying faith is exerciſed. If this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance followeth, then againe that their ſuppoſed faith doth not iuſtifie, for by their owne doctrine a ſynner Impenitent is not iuſt. For theyr applying faith is to apply (as they ſay) the promiſes of Chriſt vnto vs, but Chriſt in ſcriptures is ſo fare from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſinge
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:26120:118"/> ſaluation to man impenitent, that hee promiſeth and denownceth damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:26120:119"/> their conformitie (as they ought) firſt I argue thus.</p>
               <p>Whereſoeuer there be degrees of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Iuſtice, and man more or leſſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſo iuſtified, there muſt needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Iuſtice, and iuſtification by it: But when a man is iuſtified, there be ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of inherent Iuſtice, and more or leſſe iuſtification by it: Therefore there is iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by inherent grace, and Iuſtice. The <hi>Maior</hi> and firſt propoſition is manifeſtly true: The ſecond is proued by D. Feild: who <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Feild pag.</hi> 118.</note> acknowledgeth the denyall of inherent grace, to be vntruthe, and is ſo farre asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Proteſtant opinion in this poynt, that he writeth thus. <hi>Luther neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth inherent Righteouſnes to be more in one, then in an other, and more in Mary the Mother of Chriſt, then in any other.</hi> Then of neceſſitie there is inherent Iuſtice and grace in men iuſtified, and men be iuſtified by it, otherwiſe it is not Iuſtice or righteouſnes, if it doth not make men iuſt and righteous: for being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent as hee confeſſeth, it muſt needes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate the ſubiect wherein it is, as all inherent and intrinſecall formes and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities doe. Heate, colde, bewtie &amp;c. make men and bodyes wherein they be inherent, to be, and be called truly, hote, colde, bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull &amp;c. And ſeeing in iuſt men there be degrees of this inherent grace, and Iuſtice, encreaſe and acceſſe of it, there muſt needs be inherent grace, and Iuſtice, for new
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:26120:120"/> degrees of encreaſe are not, where the thing encreaſed is not. Neither the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue degree, <hi>(more)</hi> but where the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue is: No man or thinge can be ſaid to be better, fayrer, colder, hotter &amp;c. then it was before, except before it was good, fayre, colde, hote &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Againe I argue in this maner: whatſoeuer is the cauſe of glorie and encreaſe thereof in heauen, is the cauſe of Iuſtice and Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, from which ſuch glorie cometh: But inherent grace is the cauſe of glorie in heauen, and the differences thereof: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the cauſe of iuſtification in earthe. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euidently true: And the <hi>Minor</hi> is proued by D. Feild in theſe words: <hi>From this Imparitie of Inherent righteouſnes, it is, that there</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Feild pag.</hi> 116.</note> 
                  <hi>are ſo different degrees of Ioy and glory, fownd amonge the Saincts of God, that are in heauen.</hi> Then ſeeing the difference and exceſſe of glorie, and Ioy, in heauen proceede from the imparitie of inherent righteouſnes, or Iuſtice, and righteouſnes or Iuſtice is the cauſe of glorie, inherent Righteouſnes or Iuſtice muſt needs be that, by and for which wee are iuſtified in earth, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in heauen.</p>
               <p>Thirdly from the ſame Proteſtant Doctor I argue thus: All Iuſtice and glorie of man cometh either from inherent grace, or imputed: But not from imputed: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from that which is inherent. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident: for all grace muſt needs be
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:26120:120"/> inherent, or not inherent: and if not inherent it is by imputation, if any way at all. The ſecond propoſition is proued by D. Feild: who doth not onely renownce the error of equalitie of Ioyes, and rewards in heauen, taught by Iouinian, and ſeemeing to followe vppon the Proteſtant doctrine of Iuſtification and glory by imputation of righteouſnes: but clearely alſo confeſſeth with Catholicks, &amp; the recited Councell of Trent, Ioyes and reward in heauen for inherent Iuſtice, and not imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: his words be theſe: <hi>That there is an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Feild pag.</hi> 140.</note> 
                  <hi>of ioyes, and reward in heauen, imputed to Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinian, wee doe not hold.</hi> Where his worde <hi>(wee)</hi> and plurall number proueth hee ſpeaketh generally for Proteſtants. And concerninge the ſecond hee writeth thus: <hi>from imputed righteouſnes no imparitie of Ioy can flowe.</hi> Then ſeeing the firſt ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce graunteth <hi>an imparitie of Ioye and reward:</hi> and the ſecond affirmeth, it cometh not from imputed righteouſnes: The third and concluſion muſt needs be this: That bothe <hi>Ioy and reward in heauen, and their degrees, imparitie or inequalitie, proceede from inherent Iuſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My next Argument is this: All grace wherewith mens ſoules in Sacraments, or otherwiſe be filled, and is infuſed into them, muſt needs be inherent: But grace of iuſtification and ſanctification is ſuch: Therefore man is iuſtified by inherent grace. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident, for fillinge and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:26120:121"/> infuſion, is by putting in of things, and not by imputation: for no ſuch thinge can fill any thinge. The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proued by D. Feild ſpeakeing of children baptized: and the like reaſon is of others. His words be theſe: <hi>Children when they are adopted and made</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>the ſonnes of God, when they are inſtified and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are filled with habits or potentiall habilities, of theſe vertues faith, hope, and loue.</hi> The ſame <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Feild l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 10.</note> doctrine hee teacheth in an other place to be cited hereafter, when I shall entreate of the grace and efficacie of Sacraments: where this Article will be more declared. For this time it is further confirmed by D. Couell who alſo in playne termes approueth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Couell def. of Hooker pag.</hi> 114.</note> 
                  <hi>habituall, and reall infuſion of grace,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning iuſtification auoncheth thus: <hi>The doctrine of Luther in this poynt was not vniuſtly called</hi>

                  <hi>into queſtion, by thoſe of the Romane Church.</hi> And ſeemeth to laboure to reconcile that, which hee eſteemeth the beſt opinion of Proteſtants in this matter, to that of the Churche of Rome.</p>
               <p>Further I argue thus: All that is a guift of God a qualitie in the ſoule, an internall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, and infuſed from God, is inherent: But the grace of iuſtification is ſuch: Therefore it is inherent. The firſt propoſition is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſecond is proued by M. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wotton def. of Perk. pag.</hi> 81. 82.</note> Wotton in theſe words: <hi>Grace is ſome guift of God, which is a qualitie in the ſoule.</hi> And a little after. The habits of grace <hi>be infuſed from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:26120:121"/>
               <p>Laſtely in this matter I reaſon thus: whatſoeuer maketh euery true Chriſtian to be righteous in the ſight of God, is true Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: But Inherent grace maketh euery true Chriſtian righteous in the ſight of God: Therefore inherent grace is true Iuſtice. The <hi>Maior</hi> is manifeſtly true: And the Minor thus playnely proued by M. Wotton, in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wotton def of Perk. pag.</hi> 12. <hi>pag.</hi> 186.</note> theſe words: <hi>Wee acknowledge euery true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to be righteous in the ſight of God, by inherent Righteouſnes.</hi> And anſwering for Proteſtants and writing this for their acknowledgment in the plurall number would haue vs take it for their common opinion. And thus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke doctrine of inherent grace is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and demonſtratiuely proued to be true euen by Proteſtants. And their deniall thereof together with their conceipt of imputatiue righteous, alſo by themſelues conuinced for falſe and erroneous. Which is further confirmed by M. <hi>Higgons</hi> in his Sermon at Paules Croſſe, wherein ſpeaking of the iuſt, hee calleth them. <hi>Parſons hauing</hi>

                  <hi>grace dwelling in them.</hi> And againe: <hi>Wee haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteouſnes in our ſelues.</hi> Then ſeeing formes inherent, doe, and muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate the ſubiect, in which they inhere, and be ſubiected, as heate, cold, whitenes, blacknes, and the like, are the true cauſe, why thoſe things in which they are ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, be named, and truely are thinges hott, cold, white and blacke: ſo Iuſtice, inherent and ſubiected (as theſe men tell vs) in the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:26120:122"/> ſoules of men, muſt needs make them, both truely named, and truely and really to be iuſt. And this is euident through all the theologicall vertues <hi>faith, hope,</hi> and <hi>charitie</hi> or loue of God (all one) as in other vertues.

Of faith and beleife, wee are onely named, and are faithfull, and beleeinge; by hope, hopefull or hopeinge; by charitie or loue of God, loueing of him, and keeping his commaundements, which is mans iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as M.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ONCERNINGE the validitie, and efficacie of good workes, done in grace, ſufficient to iuſtifie: the Doctrine of the Church of Rome to be holy and ſyncere in this matter, hath beene ſufficiently proued by our contry Proteſtants, in the former chapters. But to take away all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of exception, I will a little more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſpeake of this Queſtion: Wherein the Councell of Trent hath thus defined. <hi>Eternall life is to be propoſed to thoſe, that worke well</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. Trid. ſeſſ.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>to the end, and truſting in God, both as a grace mercifully promiſed to the children of God by Ieſus Chriſt, and as a Reward by the promiſe of the ſame God, faithfully to be rendered to their good deeds, and meritts.</hi> And a little after, yeelding a reaſon, for the dignitie and worthines of ſuch good workes, addeth thus: <hi>Chriſt Ieſus himſelf as the heade to the members and vine to the braunches, doth continually inflowe vertue, anticipateth, accompanieth, and followeth allwayes their good workes, and without</hi>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:26120:123"/> 
                  <hi>which they could by no meanes, be gratefull, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious to God.</hi> Hitherto the words of the Councell, for Catholicks. Now to proue how Proteſtants doe accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to this doctrine, firſt I argue in this maner.</p>
               <p>Good workes should haue iuſtified in the ſtate of Innocencie if Adam had not fallen: Therefore they can iuſtifie being done in the ſtate of grace, by Chriſt: The paritie and conſequence is proued by the dignitie and value of Chriſts paſſion, and meritts, reſtoring for this purpoſe, that which wee loſte in Adam. The Antecedent is iuſtified by D. Couell, who comparing the good workes of Chriſtians by grace in Chriſt, repayring the fall of Adam, with workes in the ſtate of Innocencie, writeth thus: <hi>Had Adam continued in his firſt eſtate, mans abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Righteouſnes, and integritie in all his actions,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Couell def. of Hooker pag.</hi> 40.</note> 
                  <hi>had beene the way of life to him, and to all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</hi> And ſeeing this integritie in mans Actions, had tended but either to the keepeing of the precepts, or doeing works of perfection, both which by Proteſtants here after be poſſible, this reaſon conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Secondly I argue thus: whatſoeuer procureth pardon for ſins doth iuſtifie: But good workes done in grace, procure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for ſins: Therefore they iuſtifie. The firſt propoſition is euidently true: for as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſyn maketh man vniuſt; ſo that which taketh it away, muſt needs leaue him
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:26120:123"/> iuſte. The ſecond propoſition is thus proued firſt by D. <hi>Couell</hi> writing in theſe words: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Couell def. of Hooker pag.</hi> 42. <hi>Feild pag.</hi> 116.</note> 
                  <hi>Good workes, Humiliation, Faſteinge, and Weepeing are meanes to blott out ſyn.</hi> And by D. <hi>Feild</hi> alſo in this maner: <hi>Good workes done in grace procure pardon for ſynne.</hi> Againe thus I argue: That which is able to iuſtifie perfectly, in the ſight of God, and did iuſtifie <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the true beleeuers, and iuſtified, doth alſo iuſtifye vs: But good workes are of that efficacie, and did iuſtifie <hi>Abraham,</hi> our Father: Therefore they iuſtifie vs his children. The <hi>Maior</hi> is manifeſtly true. For firſt both <hi>that power and abilitie is in vayne which neuer is acted,</hi> as that common grownde in learninge teacheth: and the Proteſtants make the maner of the iuſtifyeing of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> a forme of our iuſtification. The ſecond propoſition is proued by M. <hi>Wotton,</hi> who <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wotton def. of Perk. pag.</hi> 241. <hi>ſee Wotton pag.</hi> 174. 175. <hi>and infrac.</hi> 5.</note> ſpeaketh thus in the name of Proteſtants: <hi>Wee teache, that thoſe that are in deede adiudged good workes, are able to iuſtifie a man perfectly in the preſence of God, and to deſerue euerlaſtinge life.</hi> Whereby hee doth not onely teach iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by workes of grace, but that they deſerue euerlaſteing life; but of this their worthines and meritt I will diſpute he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter. And the ſame M. <hi>Wotton</hi> in the ſame <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wotton ſup. pag.</hi> 240. <hi>Wotton ſup. pag.</hi> 203.</note> his defence of M. <hi>Perkins,</hi> writeth thus: <hi>M. Perkins profeſſeth that Abraham was iuſtified by workes, euen before God: not onely before men.</hi> This a little before the ſame place. And for himſelf concerninge the iuſtifieing of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:26120:124"/> 
                  <hi>Abraham,</hi> his words be theſe: <hi>Abraham was iuſtified longe before God made him the promiſe,</hi> and before hee came out of the land of <hi>Chanaan.</hi> Which was before his faith ſo much vrged by Proteſtants in this queſtion, was ſo commended.</p>
               <p>Further I argue thus: Nothing that is error, is true doctrine: But the deniall of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by good workes, is error: Therefore not true doctrine. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euidently true: for truthe and error are oppoſites. The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proued by D. Couell, whoſe words be theſe: <hi>To ſay wee clayme nothing by any dutie wee doe, or any vertue wee finde</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Couell def. of Hooker pag.</hi> 42.</note> 
                  <hi>in our ſelues, in the beſt conſtruction, maketh but an harshe ſownde, and diſcouereth the error, which they of the Church of Rome haue thought vs to holde.</hi> Where hee directly calleth that error, which the Romane Church hath charged Proteſtants with, in this queſtion; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſseth it to be, in extenuating good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes ſo farre, that they and vertue in vs were not ſufficient Title to clayme reward for them of God: which could not be, except they were of a iuſtifieing and deſeruing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and power.</p>
               <p>Moreouer thus I reaſon: That which is the obſeruation of the lawe, is righteouſnes, and Iuſtice: But good workes done in grace at the obſeruation of the lawe: Therefore they are righteouſnes and Iuſtice. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proued by the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Couell def. of Hooker pag.</hi> 42.</note> ſame Proteſtant Doctor in the ſame place,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:26120:124"/> and in theſe wordes: <hi>Amongſt creatures in this worlde, onely mans obſeruation of the lawe, of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is righteouſnes: onely mans tranſgreſsion ſyn.</hi> Which might alſo be ſufficient for an other Argument: for if onely transgreſſion of the lawe, is ſynne, and vniuſtice; then good workes the keeping of the lawe, muſt needs be Iuſtice. And in an other place thus the ſame Author ſpeaketh of prayer, a part of good workes: <hi>Prayer is the beſt meanes both to</hi>

                  <hi>teſtifie our dutifull affection, and moſte effectuall to obtayne, whatſoeuer wee wanting can deſire at Gods hands.</hi> D. Sutcliffe thus commendeth this good worke. <hi>By prayers wee obtaine remiſsion of</hi>

                     <hi>Sutcliff ag. D. Kelliſon pag.</hi> 72. 73.</note> 
                  <hi>ſins. By prayers wee obtayne Gods grace.</hi> And yet it is euident euen in Proteſtants doctrine, that they which haue remiſſion of ſyns, and Gods grace, are iuſt, and righteous, in their phraſe of ſpeakeinge. <note place="margin">Good deeds done in grace, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retoreous, by English Proteſtants</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now that good deeds done in grace are alſo meritorious, thus I argue: Whatſoeuer is rewarded, rewardable, bindeth an other to giue for it, was by antiquitie, and now alſo properly called meritt, is meritorious: But good workes done in grace, are ſuch: Therefore they are meritorious. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident: And the <hi>Minor</hi> thus proued firſt by D. <hi>Couell</hi> which ſpeaketh thus: That <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Couell def. of Hooker pag.</hi> 51. 52.</note> workes of perfection to which wee are not bownde, <hi>haue greater reward, then keeping of the precepts.</hi> Then bothe the one and other muſt needs haue their reward, the one
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:26120:125"/> greate, and the other greater: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be ſo meretorious, and deſerueing; for euen in our vulgare language, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of ſpeache, reward is not but where deſerueing is; ſignifyeing a Retribution or payeing againe for a thinge. Againe the ſame Proteſtant Doctor writeth thus in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coueli ſup. pag.</hi> 40. 44.</note> playne termes: <hi>Rewards doe allwayes preſuppoſe ſuch duties performed as are rewardable. It was the phraſe of Antiquitie to call our vertuous attaynment by the way of meritt. The phraſe of the Latine doth properly make one to meritt of an other, and as it were to binde him to him, who doth any thinge which pleaſeth, and delighteth him, for whome it is done.</hi> Which ſufficiently proueth that ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. And from this graunt, this matter is thus, further demonſtrated by their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles to which they haue, all ſubſcribed, <note place="margin">

               <p>Whatſoeuer all Chriſtians Iuſtely vowe to keepe and performe, that in all true
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:26120:130"/> doctrine they are able to keepe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme: But by the opinion of English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, all Chriſtians vowe to keepe the commaundements: Therefore they may, and muſt keepe them. The <hi>Maior</hi> is manifeſt by Proteſtants, graunteing with the holy ſcriptures, and Fathers, that iuſt vowes be both of things poſſible, and muſt be kept: for if the iuſt promiſe of man to man bindeth, how much more a iuſt promiſe to God, which is a vowe obligatory and byn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deing? The <hi>Minor</hi> is proued by the publicke Proteſtant English communion booke, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confirmed by his Maieſties authoritie: which both teacheth, that <hi>wee are bownde to</hi>

                  <hi>keepe the commaundements, and all that are baptized vowe to doe it.</hi> Then ſeeing all English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, doe either ſweare, or ſubſcribe vnto, and dayly followe and execute the doctrine, and preſcription of that their authenticall <hi>Rituall,</hi> and <hi>Directorie,</hi> as they cannot by their oath or ſubſcription deny it without periury or denyall of their faith: ſo by the rule it ſelf, they committ ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in reiecting that doctrine.</p>
               <p>Secondly I argue thus: All things that are of neceſſitie to bee obſerued, or kept of men, in Religion, are poſſible: But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements are of neceſſitie to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and kept: Therefore they are poſſible. The <hi>Maior</hi> is ſo euidently true, that if it were falſe, all Chriſtians of neceſſitie muſt be damned, and none ſaued, not beeing able

The <hi>Minor</hi> is proued by the preſent Proteſtant Archbishops of Canterbury, and D. Feilds allowed Greeke Church: which cenſureth thus: <hi>The commaundements of God of neceſsitie are</hi>

               <p>Further I argue thus: All that graunt the doctrine of the Church of Rome (expreſſed before out of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent)</hi> to be true in this point, and that God exacteth of vs to keepe the commaundements, muſt needs graunt the poſſibilitie, to doe it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent herein with Catholickes: But English Proteſtants doe, or muſt doe ſo: Therefore they muſt graunt this poſſibilitie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

If true charitie ſuch as keepeth the commaundements, may be had in this life, them they may be kept: But ſuch charitie may be had in this life: Therefore the commaundements, may be kept.

The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore may be kept, for things vnpoſſible neither are, nor can be done. <hi>Ad impoſsibilia non eſt potentia: Ther is no power to things vnpoſsible.</hi> And the ſame Proteſtant writer, ſpeakeing of inherent Iuſtice writeth thus: <hi>Neither doe wee (Proteſtants) deny, that this inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes</hi>

                  <hi>will of man hath not obtayned grace by freedome, but freedome by grace.</hi> Meaneing that by the grace of Chriſt man is made free to doe all duties, in ſupernaturall and religeous affaires, of themſelues aboue the naturall power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is aſſiſted by ſpirituall, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall help and grace. And concerning the naturall power it ſelf, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of grace, hee ſpeaketh in this maner: <hi>There is in the will of man, naturally that freedome, whereby it is apt, to take or refuſe, any particular</hi>

                  <hi>obiect whatſoeuer, beinge preſented vnto it.</hi> And frome hence I argue further in this order.</p>
               <p>That without which mans actions are neyther good nor euill, muſt needs be graunted: But free will in man, is ſuch: Therefore it muſt needs be graunted. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident: for if mens actions were neyther good nor euill, there could be no reward for vertue, becauſe nothing should be vertue, where nothinge is good: nor punishment for ſyn, becauſe nothing could be ſyn, where nothing could be euill. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proued by D. <hi>Couell,</hi> who aſcribeth to this freedome of mans will, the goodnes and malice of humane actions, as if hee would ſay, if man had not freedome, and libertie of will, his Actions could not be

               <p>Againe I argue thus: All that graunt, and acknowledge the truthe, of the doctrine of the ſchoolemen, and of the Church of Rome in this poynt, and further, that man hath libertie to vertue, and vice, muſt needs graunt free will in man: But theſe English Proteſtant writers following, graunt theſe things: Therefore they muſt graunt free will in man.

For (as S. Bernard ſaith) there is a threefold freedome, from neceſsitie, from ſyn, from miſery; the firſt of nature, the ſeconde of grace, the third of glorie. In the firſt from the bondadge of coaction, the will is free in it owne nature, and hath power ouer it ſelf. In the ſeconde, the will is not free, but freed from the bondadge of ſyn. And in the third it is freed from the ſeruitude of corruption.

               <p>All that conſent with the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, in this queſtion, graunt this diſtinction of precepts and counſayles, as it doth: But theſe English Proteſtants accompted lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned writers, amonge which are cited here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, doe ſo conſent with the Romane Church: Therefore they graunt, or ought

                  <hi>one is of abſolute neceſsitie, The other left vnto our free election. To caſt away wholly the things of the world, is no precept of neceſsitie, but an aduiſe of greater perfection. Hee that obeyeth not a precept, is guiltie of deſerued punishment: but hee that faileth of theſe counſayle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hee that performeth the one, shall haue greater glory, but hee that fayleth of the other, (without repentance) shall haue certayne punishment. Neither is it ſaid, ſaith S.

                  <hi>Thoſe vnleſſe they be done, are punished. For ſaith S. Hierome, where it is, but aduiſe, there is left a freedome: But where there is a precept, there is a neceſsitie. Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is none of any ſecond Iudgment in our Church, which doth not thinke, that willinge pouertie, humble obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and true chaſtitie, are things very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and doe bringe with them greate aduantadge, to the true perfection of a Chriſtian life.

               <p>Wherefore out of this graunts thus I argue againe: what ſoeuer Catholicke do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ſo certaine, and allowed, that it is warranted by the word of God, the lawe of reaſon, by S. Auguſtine, S. Hierome,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:26120:139"/> the primatiue Church, and denyed by no Proteſtant of Iudgment, by Proteſtant te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, that without all doubt is true: But this Catholicke doctrine is ſuch, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and warranted: Therefore it is true. The <hi>Maior</hi> is without all queſtion true: for thoſe Rules of true doctrine, the worde of God, primatiue Church &amp;c. Neither in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke or Proteſtant proceedings can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue vs: The <hi>Minor</hi> is proued by the very words of the Proteſtant Doctors before cited. Therefore I will conclude with this Argument following.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer Church, or congregation, graunteth, ſo many workes, and eſtates of perfection, as before they haue recompted, Pouertie, Chaſtitie, and Obedience, and yet in life and execution do not practize any one of them in any condition, company, fraternitie, or congregation, in any, one place or contry in ſo longe time, as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie hath Raigned, but ſpoiled, abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, perſecuted, or ouerthrowne all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteryes, howſes and communities liuing in ſuch perfection, neither is, nor can be the true, and perfect Church and ſpowſe of Chriſt; but that which proceedeth in the contrary courſe: But the Churche or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of Proteſtants are in this caſe, as all men knowe, and the Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church in the contrary diſpoſition and ſtate: Therefore the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not true, but onely the Catholicke.

               <p>Whatſoeuer doctrine, is contrary to the doctrine of all Churches accounted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, is erroneous, and in the contrary to that, which is warranted by truthe, is not true: But that Proteſtant doctrine, which denieth the diuers kynds, degrees, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſyns, is ſuch: Therefore it is not true.

               <p>That doctrine which hath ſcandalized all Churches, and leaueth many followers of that Religion, wherein it is taught, ill ſatisfied, cannot be true; But the doctrine of diuers Proteſtants in this queſtion, is ſuch: Therefore it cannot be true.

               <p>When two Churches are at difference in Religion, and by graunt of both, one is the true Church of Chriſt, and differ in many greate queſtions, and many of eſſentiall poynts by the graunt of Proteſtants being one of the Churches, and the other Church by their Iudgment onely to haue an vnion needeth to relinquish fyue things, and none of them eſſentiall, but diſpenſable all, and the other Church to ſubmitt in all others, then by thas doctrine which Proteſtants haue taught vs in the firſt chapter of the firſt parte of this worke about the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the true Church, and generally that it cannot erre in any eſſentiall thinge, that Church which is by the Aduerſaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in this ſtate of truth in all things eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall, is the true Church, and the other falſe: But by the Proteſtant <hi>Relator</hi> before,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:26120:145"/> the Romane Church is in this ſtate of truthe, and the Proteſtants Church in the contrary: Therefore the Romane Church is true, and that of Proteſtants falſe.

               <p>Fourthly I argue thus: All men allowing Honor, Reuerence, or worship to the ſigne or Imadge of the Croſſe of Chriſt, muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe it to his immediate and perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenting
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:26120:148"/> Imadge: But theſe English Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants allowe it to the ſigne or picture of the croſſe of Chriſt: Therefore they ought to allowe it to his Imadge; And ſo of others by like proportion. The <hi>Maior</hi> is ſufficiently proued before, as alſo that the ſigne of the croſſe is leſſe figuring and preſenting Chriſt, then his owne Imadge: The Minor is proued thus by their owne writings.

               <p>Further I argue thus out of M.

The <hi>Maior</hi> being before proued: The Minor is iuſtified by M. Burges in his <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Fiftely in this Queſtion I argue thus: whatſoeuer doctrine about Imadges was practized by S. Baſile and the primatiue Church, is true, and may ſtill be practized: But ſuch vſe of Imadges as is with Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks now was then practized: Therefore it may ſtill be practized. The firſt propoſition is often proued and graunted before: And the <hi>Minor</hi> thus proued by theſe Proteſtants: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wotton def. ſup. pag.</hi> 594.</note> firſt. M. Wotton graunteth from S. Baſile, theſe words: <hi>I honor the hiſtory of Imadges, and doe properly worshipp them.</hi> Therefore they <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Perlins probl. pag.</hi> 78.</note> may be ſo ſtill vſed. M. Perkins writeth thus: <hi>The vſe of Imadges was publicke in Churches</hi>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:26120:149"/> 
                  <hi>within the firſt</hi> 400. <hi>yeares.</hi> And againe: <hi>The Imadge of Mary the virgin was wont to be caryed in ſolemne pompe, ſolemni in pompa efferri.</hi> And ſo no doubt reuerenced, as whatſoeuer is ſo ſolemnly caryed and borne in pompe and honor, muſt needs be vſed: The very bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it ſelf in ſuch order being a reuerence.</p>
               <p>Laſtely I make this Argument: ſuch vſe of Imadges as was practized by the Iewes in the time of the lawe, is ſtill lawfull for Chriſtians: But the Iewes in that time did practize without reprehenſion the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp or reuerence of Imadges: therefore it is now lawfull. The Maior is euident, for all dyuines graunt, that the prohibition to the Iewes (prone to Idolatrie) was as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere or more to them, then to Chriſtians. The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus graunted by M. <hi>Wotton:</hi> The Iewes in the Temple before Chriſt, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wotton def. of Perk. pag.</hi> 581. 582.</note> 
                  <hi>did worshippe the pictures of the Cherubyns.</hi> Then if the pictures of <hi>Cherubins,</hi> being mere Creatures, were publickly in the temple worshipped, how much more is the picture, and Imadge of their and our Lord, Ieſus Chriſt to be had in reuerence, and ſo to be vſed: And ſo of Imadges of his ſeruants, and Saincts in their due proportion: Becauſe the Saincts themſelues may be honored, and prayed vnto, as I am to proue by theſe Proteſtants in the next chapter. And this is further proued by theſe Proteſtant <note place="margin">

                  <hi>All Ceremonies may be diuided thus: ſome were for iuſtifications, ſuch as the lawe commaunded, whereby the obſeruer was made more purified, and more holy. In place whereof afterward ſucceeded thoſe, that were for ornament, and to ſignifie ſuch vertues, as were requiſite in thoſe parties, that rightly vſe them. Secondly in Reſpect of the Author, ſome were ordinances of nature, as to looke vp to heauen, to lyft vp the hands, to howe the knees, to knocke the breaſt, and ſuch like, when wee pray, things vſed in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion by the Heathens themſelues: others were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God himſelf, ſome by the Apoſtles, and Bishops, that ſucceeded in their place: thirdly ſome in the parts of the immediate worship, as ſacrifice, prayer, adoration, and ſuch-like: ſome onely diſpoſe,</hi>

Fourthly of theſe ſome, reſpect parſons, ſome times, ſome other concerne places, all which concurringe in a dyuine worship, are with Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes by ſeperation made ſacred, and ſo fitter to ſerue vnto holy vſes.

                  <hi>There is nothinge, can be a ſurer preſeruer of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then to keepe it from contempt: a thinge not eaſely done, where it is left deſtitute and depriued of holy Ceremonies. For the principall excellency of our Religion being ſpirituall, is not eaſely obſerued, of the greatet number, which are carnall: and therefore wee propownde not naked myſteryes, but cloathe them: that theſe offeringe to the ſences a certayne Maieſtie, may be receaued of the minde, with a greater Reuerence. And therefore ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, accounting them as the shell to the kernell, haue ſaide, that noe Religion, either true or falſe, was able to conſiſt without them.</hi> Hitherto the words of this Proteſtant Doctor. From which I firſt argue in this maner.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer Religion omitteth, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecteth thoſe things, which are ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for the preſeruation of true Religion, that it cannot conſiſt without them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the true Religion: But the English
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:26120:157"/> Proteſtant Religion is ſuch: therefore it cannot be true. The firſt propoſition is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true in the light of nature: for any thinge that is neceſſarie for the preſeruation of an other, cannot be ſeperated from it. The ſecond propoſition is likewiſe Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, for the Proteſtants of England neither eſteeme ſo of Ceremonies, as this Doctor telleth vs, they ought to be accompted of, neither retayne ſuch Ceremonies, as his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions comprehend, as is euident. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Romane Church is true, and the Ceremonies thereof holy, otherwiſe there should be no true Church, or Ceremonies practized: and conſequently no true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by this Doctor before.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſuppoſing, as before is graunted by theſe Proteſtants, that either their Church, Religion, and Ceremonies, or the Romane Church, Religion and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies be true, I argue thus: No Church, or Religion, which omitteth, and denyeth thoſe holy Ceremonies which are parts of the immediate worship, and the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, can be the true Church, and Religion: But contrariwiſe that which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth and alloweth them: But the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant English Church omitteth, and denieth ceremonyes, parts of the immediate wors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hippe, and the inſtruments thereof, that is, <hi>ſacrifice, altares,</hi> &amp;c. which D. <hi>Couell</hi> telleth vs before to be ſuch, and the Romane Church embraceth and alloweth them: Therefore
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:26120:157"/> the Romane Church and Ceremonyes, and not the Proteſtants are true. Bothe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are manifeſt: Therefore the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonyes of the Romane Church be holy, reuerent, &amp;c. otherwiſe no true Church and Religion could haue them, or be ſuch.</p>
               <p>Thirdly I argue thus: The true Church hath power to decree Rites, or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and conſequently to bynde others to receaue them, and not reiect them: But by <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> the graunt of Proteſtants in the firſt part, the Romane Church was the true Church when it ordayned all ceremonies now vſed in it: Therefore they ought to be vſed and bynde all men to receaue them, and ſo are conſequently holy, decent, reuerent &amp;c. The <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition conſiſteth of the <note place="margin">

               <p>Againe I argue thus, from the Relator himſelfe: Thoſe Ceremonies which breede order in the Church, auoyde ſcandall, giue propagation vnto Religion, breede vnitie, and doe ingender, quicken, encreaſe, and

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:26120:161"/> theſe Queſtions: And firſt of Indulgences, in which I argue thus.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer graunt that the Church hath authoritie and power both to forgiue ſyns, and to remitt the ſeueritie or punishment due for ſyn, muſt needs graunt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke doctrine of <hi>Indulgence:</hi> being nothing els but ſuch Relaxation: But the English Proteſtants doe, or by their writing muſt graunt this forgiuenes of ſynne, and releaſe of paine due for ſynne: Therefore they doe, or ought to allowe the Catholicke doctrine of Indulgence.

Feild l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note> true, by the common acceptance and definition of Indulgence, both with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks and Proteſtants, which is a Releaſe of payne, for ſynne enioyned or to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned. The <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition is proued from D. <hi>Feild</hi> in theſe words: <hi>The true Churche admitteth and receaueth all that with ſorrowfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance returne, and ſeeke reconciliation, how greate ſoeuer their offences haue beene: not forgetting to vſe due ſeueritie, which yet shee ſometime remitteth.</hi> And reciting the cauſes of ſuch remiſſion, hee addeth thus: <hi>The due and iust conſideration, mouing the Church to remitt ſome thinge of her wonted ſeueritie is, either priuate or publicke perill.</hi> And for proofe of this doctrine, hee citeth <note place="margin">1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 8. 9. 10.</note> that place of S. Paule, to the Corinthians, of graunting Indulgence or relaxation of payne to the inceſtuous parſon. Whereby manifeſtly appeareth that in this <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctors Iudgment, authoritie and power
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:26120:162"/> ought to be allowed to the Church, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe and remitt ſeueritie, and punishment due for ſynne; which is the ſame which is termed Indulgence. Neither can hee finde any euaſion by diſtinguisheing between pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances enioyned, and not enioyned. For that power, facultie, and authoritie, which can enioyne penance, and after it is enioyned, rebeace it againe, cannot be interpreted, but (at leaſte, in that ſupreame Paſtor, to whome the higheſt prerogatiue of binding, looſing, and releacinge, is committed) to haue habilitie, to pardon, remitt, or releace it, before it be enioyned. Secondly thus I argue: That doctrine and practize, which the auncient primatiue Bishops of Chriſts Churche held and vſed, is true, and to be continued: But the doctrine and practice of Indulgences is ſuch: Therefore true, and to be continued. The <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true, often graunted before, by theſe Proteſtants: and the <hi>Minor</hi> thus proued by D. <hi>Feild,</hi> in theſe wordes: <hi>The auncient Bishops</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Feild. ſup. l.</hi> 1 <hi>c.</hi> 17. <hi>pag.</hi> 33.</note> 
                  <hi>were wont to cutt of greate partes of enioyned pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: which remiſsion and relaxation was called an Indulgence.</hi> And that is to noe purpoſe, which hee addeth immediatly in theſe termes: <hi>Out of the not vnderſtanding whereof, grewe the popish pardons and Indulgences.</hi> For firſt how more probable it is, that the Bishops of the Romane Church, immediately and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely ſucceeding theſe auncient Bishops, practizeing the true doctrine, and vſe of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:26120:162"/> Indulgences, should continually preſerue it, and vnderſtand it, then thoſe, which by interpoſition of a thowſand and more yeares, come after them, and without any order epiſcopall, or preiſtly, but by vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and intruſion (as is proued by theſe Proteſtants themſelues in this treatice) teach, and of their owne heads propoſe the contrary? ſecondly his exceptiue addition deſtroyeth his entent for which it is allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and Proteſtants opinion in this poynt: for the ſubſtance of Catholicke doctrine concerninge Indulgences, to make it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leace of payne due for ſynne, is the ſame with the practice of thoſe auncient Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, by him allowed, as is proued before, and in all congruitie hee that both can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and take away punishment, can much rather take it away without infliction: for hee that can doe twoe things, can muche more and with greater facilitie doe one of them: becauſe this one is conteyned in thoſe twoe, and power of doeing the one of neceſſitie muſt needs be graunted to him, that hath power to doe bothe: eſpecially the higheſt Ruler and Gouernor in ſuch things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly thus I argue: Whatſoeuer do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or practize, theſe English Proteſtants teache, or exerciſe, in their publicke and iudiciall courts, and Conſiſtories, that they may not denye to be lawfull: But in ſuch authoritatiue places, and Iudgments, they
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:26120:163"/> allowe, and approue the Catholicke do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerninge Indulgences: Therefore they may not deny it. The <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition is manifeſtly true, otherwiſe two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories might be true, and in Religion which is vnpoſſible. The <hi>Minor</hi> alſo is as eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently certayne, by their ordinary and vſuall releaſe, and relaxation of payne, and ſeueritie due for ſynne, againſt the auncient primatyue Canons, allowed by them, and by no pretext iuſtifiable, but by way of Indulgence, as appeareth playnely in their proceedings. And this euen in caſes and cauſes ſcandalous moſte requiring ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and penance in their owne doctrine. If they thinke their Relaxation or Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence therein to be fruſtrate, their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings therein be impious, and they decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: if they allow them for iuſt, they alſo allowe Indulgences, being nothinge els but a releaſe of ſuch penance and ſeueritie, as before.

               <p>Fourthly thus I argue: Whoſoeuer graunt, and allowe Authoritie, to abſolute penitents in confeſſion, both <hi>a paena, &amp; culpa: from the punishment and guilt of ſynne,</hi> muſt mayntaine the doctrine of Indulgences: But theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Proteſtants graunt authoritie to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue both from the guilt, and punishment of ſynne, therefore they muſt mayntayne the doctrine of Indulgences. The <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition is often proued and allowed before.

               <p>That which was the practice of the churche of Chriſt, from the firſt conuerſion of nations vnto him, vntill this age, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, is ſtill to bee obſerued or lawfully may: But the publicke church ſeruice to bee in the latine tonge in this part of the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, wherein wee liue, was euer ſoe vſed and practized: Therefore ſtill it ought or may bee ſoe lawfully continued. The firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is euidently true, and before often graunted by theſe Proteſtants. The ſeconde is thus proued by D. <hi>Doue</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Bishop</hi> of <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Latine: in the eaſt part in Greeke euen amonge thoſe nations, to whome theſe languadges were no mother tonges.</hi> And this the confeſſeth, to haue beene the cuſtome from the firſt conuerſion of nations. For theſe two languadges, Latine, and Greeke, with the Hebrue, beeing the learned tonges of the world, (and the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues and Iewes eſpecially in Iury, for the moſte part remayninge in incredulitie) The learned and religeous Conuerters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to Chriſt, often not vnderſtandinge their barbarous languadges, but preaching and perſuading by Interpretors, yett vſeing a publicke <hi>Liturgie, Maſſe</hi> or church ſeruice, could neither practize it for themſelues, or frame it for others, in their tonges vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. Of which D. <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> giueth vs a fitt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall example, of this nation English: his words of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> coming hither from <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> Pope of Rome to conuert vs, are theſe: <hi>comming alſoe into Kent, hee was not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>able to ſpeake one worde of English, nor to preache, vnleſſe it were by his Interpretor.</hi> And yett hee doth, and muſt needs acknowledge, that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> vſed a publicke <hi>Liturgie,</hi> and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, which could be none in any equall Iudgment, but that which was vſed in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, &amp; hee brought from thence. And in no wiſe English for this hee muſt either find among the Infidells, which could not bee: or els to be compoſed by him or his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciats, or by them tranſlated, which cannot be Imagined, they neither (as before vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:26120:166"/> our languadge to compoſe it, for the Inhabitants, or vſe it for themſelues. But this they haue confeſſed before.</p>
               <p>Againe thus I argue: Such church ſeruice, maſſe, or liturgie, and in ſuch tonge, as was ſunge in the citie of Conſtantinople it ſelf the cheefe citie of Greece, and in the time of a generall Councell, and yett not in Greeke, may with as good reaſon, or more be now vſed in England, or any ſuch nation: But the latine Maſſe was then and there ſunge. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore it may bee ſtill vſed in England and other nations. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident: for by no probabilitie the commaunding citie of Greece and of the chriſtian world at that time, and a generall Councell there and then aſſembled, would haue allowed a publicke abſurditie in Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: hauing ſo much more shew of authoritie to reprehend and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, euen by Proteſtants ſentence then they haue. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proued by M<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hull in theſe words: <hi>Latine Maſſe was ſunge at the ſixt Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node</hi>

               <p>Thirdly thus I argue: all that allowe of the publicke church ſeruice in a ſtraunge and barbarous tonge to people not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ought in al reaſon rather to allowe it in the latine, a learned and common tonge to all learned, in this part of the world: But the English Proteſtants allowe of the church ſeruice in ſuch a barbarous tonge vnknowne: Therefore by much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they muſt approue of the publicke ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice

               <p>Fourthly ſuppoſing, as often is proued before, the primatiue Church, and practize thereof to bee a warrant vnto vs, as alſo that (which no Proteſtant can deny) the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Latine Church to bee at the leaſte equal with the Greeke: and that which all experience and obſeruation by lyuing among Greeks, and Romanes proueth that the preſent vulgare Greeke languadge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Greece is altogether different from that learned tonge of Greece vſed in the primatiue Church with the holy Fathers, of that Church in thoſe times, as <hi>S. Baſile, S. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> and ſuch others, thus I argue.</p>
               <p>The preſent Greeke Church (allowed for the true Church before by Proteſtants) pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Laſtely in this point, ſuppoſing the mayne graunde of Proteſtants againſt Latine ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to bee, becauſe ſo the vulgare and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant not vnderſtanding it remayne without due Inſtruction, as they pretend, I argue thus. That Church (whether it is the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, or the Proteſtant) which by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and graunte of the oppoſites and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, doth much more duely, truely, and diligently, inſtructe, and catechiſe yong peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the ignorant both by word, and writing in their knowne and common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guadge, then the other doth, is not to bee condemned either of negligence or vnskill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes in this buſines: But the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> teſtimonie is in this caſe: Therefore not to bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

The <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true, by often graunte before. And the <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proued. Firſt D. <hi>Willet</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

               <p>Secondly I argue thus againe: That which was the cuſtome and doctrine of the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, may, or is ſtill to bee kept and defended: But to pray at the monuments of Saincts, and reuerence their Relicks was the cuſtome and doctrine then: Therefore ſtill to bee kept, and defended.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly thus I argue: That vſadge and behauiour which was lawfull to the Iewes, and practized of them towards their Reliks, is now in the time of grace, giuen by Chriſt, as lawfull for Chriſtians, towards their holy Relicks, and things: But the true faithfull Iewes lawfully vſed reuerence and honour to their Relicks: Therefore it is lawfull to Chriſtians to doe the like. The <hi>Maior</hi> is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, this beeing no ceremoniall or legall thinge, abrogated by Chriſt, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, by making the things of his lawe and Ghoſpell more reuerentiall, then the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue was: The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proued by <hi>M.

                  <hi>Arke, but the holy of holyes, becauſe of the things, that</hi>

                  <hi>were in it. Hee makes the Propitiatorie, Manna, Aarons Rod, and the golden Altare, cauſes of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as well as the Cherubins. In the words followinge hee counts the Sepulchre of our Lord more worthie of wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hip.</hi> Then ſeeing thoſe Relicks vnder the lawe, and before Chriſt (the meritorious cauſe of all grace, and ſuch excellencie) were ſo worthie of worshipp, and reuerence, that they were not onely reuerenced in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but other things were worshipped and reuerenced becauſe of them: and yett by this Iudgment the Relicks in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (as the Sepulchre, no part of Chriſt, but the place of his ſacred bodies ſome few howers lyeing there) <hi>are more worthie of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> as this Proteſtant writer confeſſeth: wee may not deny this Reuerence, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick doctrine thereof, to bee holy, euen by English Proteſtants ſentence.</p>
               <p>Laſtely thus I argue, from the generall practice of English Proteſtants: if it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to giue ciuill reuerence to the bodie of a noble man, or woman deceaſed, becauſe they were noble, and honored when they liued, much more reaſon there is, to giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeous and ſpirituall Reuerence to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of a Saint, holy and honored by God, and man, when hee lyued, and now in Ioyes, in heauen, truely and for euer honorable: But the Antecedent is true, by English Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, whoe by their <hi>Heralds</hi> of armes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, and practice, that all Inferiours shall giue and yeeld the ſame honour to the bodie
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:26120:171"/> of the honorable parſon deceaſed, that was due vnto him, lyuing his ſoule and bodie beeing vnited; and this though in all morall Iudgment the ſoule of ſuch an one is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And this is the cuſtome and ceremonie, not onely with <hi>Heralds,</hi> but vſed in Court, ratified by their Bishops, Doctors, and Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, as many and late examples teache, which I will vrge no further, but deſire all may liue and die well, that they may leaue behinde them ſufficient, or ſome motiue, eyther to bee honored, or helped by the prayers and deuotions of the lyuinge. The conſequence is euidently true, and thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as excellencie is the cauſe of honor, and ciuill excellency of ciuill and terrene honor: ſo ſpirituall or religeous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of ſpirituall, and ſuch honor. And much more: for the ciuill honor and motiue thereof is onely <hi>ens rationis,</hi> an inuention, worthines, and attribute of men, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all Inherent in the bodie, or ſoule of the partie ſo honored: when the other excellency and cauſe of honor, is both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, and an Inherent dignitie, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before of inherent Iuſtice, and for euer remayneth in the ſoule glorified, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, his Saints, and Angells in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and there by them eſteemed truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of honor.</p>
               <p>And how honorable ſuch holy Relicks haue euer beene, eſpecially in this nation, from the firſt conuerſion thereof to Chriſt,

The primatiue Church thought the ſanctified and conſecrated Elements to bee the bodie of Chriſt.</hi> Where hee plainely confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that thoſe primatiue Fathers ment as they ſpoke, and both ſpake and ment, as Catholicks now doe, that Chriſt is really

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:26120:177"/> hee confeſſed to much, then to little in that Matter. And the preſent Proteſtant Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Canterbury ſpeaketh of him in theſe words: <hi>Berengarius in deed was onely called</hi>

Whoſoeuer maintayne a doctrine publickly, and Iuridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally reca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, &amp; abiured be Hereticks: But al English Sacramentaries bee ſuch: Therefore they bee Hereticks: and the contrary is true Catholicke doctrine. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euidently true: And the <hi>Minor</hi> proued before by their cited <hi>Archbishop,</hi> teaching (which they all confeſſe) that the recanted and abiured he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of <hi>Berengarius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> is the ſame which they defend. Againe thus I argue: whatſoeuer thinge, beeing Chriſts bodie, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued of vs: and is with deuotion to bee receaued, becauſe it is his bodie: and is after an ineffable maner his bodie: and by grace made Chriſts bodie: and is his bodie preſent in the ſanctified elements, is the true bodie of Chriſt: But the B. Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:26120:177"/> is ſo: Therefore it is the true bodie of Chriſt. The <hi>Maior</hi> is manifeſtly true: And the <hi>Minor</hi> thus proued by theſe Proteſtants. Firſt D. Doue Proteſtant Bishop of <hi>Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>

Wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue it with reuerence and deuotion, becauſe it is his bodie.</hi> And approueth the Catholick doctrine of Bishop <hi>Gardiner</hi> and others, ſaying with allowance thus! <hi>Stephen Gardiner and the learned of their Church were wont to ſay, it was his bodie ineffabili modo, after an vnſpeakable maner, after ſuch a maner as mens tonges could not vtter.</hi> And ſo ſay all Catholicks at this day, numbering this amonge the greate myſteries of Chriſtian Religion, as the auncient fathers did. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſacramentaries are confounded: For to ſay, or thinke that breade and wyne may bee figures of Chriſts bodie, and blood, as many other things are, and diuers things bee figures of others, is neither vnſpeakable, or not able to bee vttered, but a thinge ſo eaſie to bee conceaued, and ſpoken, that euery ignorant man can both without difficultie conceaue, and vtter it. Againe the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant <hi>Bishop</hi> thus writeth of Catholicks in <note place="margin">Doue ſupr.</note> England: <hi>If they will receaue at our hands, wee will not bee ouer haſtie with them to examine them, how they doe expound the words, Hoc est Corpus meum, this is my bodie.</hi> Which no man of conſcience, and learning can write, much leſſe a pretender to bee a Bishop and Paſtor, except hee doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly

               <p>Whatſoeuer is the reall and true bodie, and blood, of Chriſt, now vnſeperable from his moſte bleſſed ſoule and is publickly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto God by the lawfully called and authorized preiſts of his Church, is a true, publicke, and holy ſacrifice: But that which is commonly called the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> or bleſſed Sacrament of the altare, offered by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke preiſts, of the Romane Church in Maſſe, is ſuch: Therefore it is a true pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke and holy ſacrifice. The <hi>Maior propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is euidently true and confeſſed of all men of learning in Chriſtianitie, neither can be doubted of any, that is ignorant if hee knoweth the termes themſelues expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely ſignifieing and shewing the veritie thereof euen by the light of nature. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond propoſition is alſo more then aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proued and verified by theſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in the laſt chapter: yet to giue it a further (though needles) confirmation, I
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:26120:181"/> proue it againe in this order to be a ſacrifice externall and publicke.</p>
               <p>That doctrine which that Church, which is eſteemed by Proteſtants to be the true Church teacheth, is to be allowed: But this doctrine of Chriſts bleſſed bodie, and blood, to be ouer publicke ſacrifice, in the Church, is ſuch: Therefore it is ſo to be allowed. The firſt propoſition is often graunted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and the ſecond of the Greeke Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches opinion, and practice, both at this preſent, and from the time of the primatiue dayes of chriſtianitie, to be agreeable with the preſent Romane Church, is iuſtified by the <hi>Proteſtant Relator</hi> of Religion in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of holy ceremonies His words (to make <note place="margin">

               <p>That doctrine, and publicke practice of Sacrifice, or other, which was inſtituted by Chriſt, practized by his Apoſtles, and ſuch holy Saincts and Doctors of the Churche, as Sainct Baſile, S.

There is none of any ſound Iudgment in our Church, which doth not thinke, that willing pouertie, humble obedience, and true chaſtitie, are things verie commendable, and doe bringe with them greate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantadge to the true perfection of a Chriſtian life.

That doctrine which is taught by that Church, which is neither hereticall, nor damnably ſciſmaticall cannot bee hereticall, nor damnable, but orthodoxe, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke: But the doctrine of <hi>Purgatorie</hi> is taught by this ſo Iuſtified Church, the Greeke Church.

Which doe muche differ from the Sacraments of the olde lawe, for they did not cauſe grace, but did onely figure that it was to be giuen by the paſsion of Chriſt. But theſe of ours bothe conteyne grace, and giue it vnto them that worthely receaue them.</hi> Hitherto the decree of that holy generall Councell, receaued by all Chriſtendome, <hi>Latines, Armenians, Iacobynes, Grecians.</hi> From whence I further argue in this maner.</p>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:26120:196"/>
               <p>Whatſoeuer doctrine eſſentiall in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, (ſuch as Sacraments be) is taught by the true Church, that is neither hereticall, nor Sciſmaticall, is to be embraced: But the doctrine of ſeuen Sacraments, as the Romane Church teacheth, is ſuch, being likewiſe taught by the Proteſtants true Greeke Churche: therefore to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. The <hi>Maior</hi> is alſo proued in the laſte Argument, and further confirmed in the Cenſure of the Greeke Church, vppon Proteſtants in theſe words: <hi>There is an holy</hi>

                  <hi>Catholicke and Apoſtolicke Churche, of all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men. In this Catholicke and true beleeuing Church there be ſeuen diuine Sacraments, Baptiſme, the Vnction of holy Oyntment, holy Communion, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Matrimonie, Penance, and the oyle of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame Vnction.</hi> And they further proſecute (as alſo the cited generall Councell of <hi>Florence</hi> doth) the inſtitution, forme, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, effect, and other things, belonging to theſe ſeuen holy <hi>Sacraments,</hi> according to the preſent doctrine, of the Romane Churche.</p>
               <p>Againe, I ſuppoſe, that Catholickes in their definition of the Sacraments of the new lawe, requiring a conteyning and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueing of grace, by theſe holy Sacraments, beſides their ſignification thereof: (being onely ſignes, Seales &amp;c. as the common Proteſtant opinion is) to be farre more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted, and limited, then that of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, becauſe many more thinges be, and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:26120:197"/> may be ſignes of any thinge, then bothe ſignes, and cauſes: as appeareth to be true in all genericall and ſpecificall differences.

Chapter of Indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces.</note> a ſigne to bee a meanes of grace.</p>
               <p>Concerninge <hi>Penance,</hi> to bee a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> I haue made demonſtration before in the chapter of Indulgences, and it is euidently true in this order. Whereſoeuer in any ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, and externall ſigne, grace is ſo amply giuen, that not onely all guilt of ſynnes by Proteſtants, but their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are forgiuen, and by authoritie from Chriſt, there muſt needs bee both an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ceremonie or ſigne inſtituted by him, and a Sacrament: But thus it is in theſe Proteſtants Iudgments in <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution:</hi> Therefore a Sacrament. Bothe the <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> are aboundantly proued in the recited chapter before. And to proue, that ſuch confeſſion may bee auricular, (as they terme our Catholike confeſſion to a preiſt) though that kinde of confeſſion is not ſoe needfull to make it a Sacrament: M. Hull writeth thus: <hi>Auricular confeſsion was</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>vſed in the primatiue Churche,</hi> before the time of <hi>Zozomenus</hi> the auncient hiſtorian. And his Maieſtie in the Conference at Hampton <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conference pag.</hi> 13.</note> witneſſeth: <hi>That the particular and parſonall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution from ſyn, after confeſsion, is apoſtolicall and a verie godly ordinance.</hi> Therefore I thus argue againe.</p>
               <p>That which was vſed in the primatiue Churche, is an externall ceremonie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueing ſyn, an Apoſtolicall, and godly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:26120:201"/> is a ſigne ordeyned by Chriſt, and a Sacrament: But <hi>Penance</hi> is ſuch: Therefore it is a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Bothe propoſitions are graunted, and proued before.</p>
               <p>And hence alſo is proued, that <hi>Orders</hi> is a <note place="margin">Orders a Sacrament by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of England.</note> Sacrament. For: whoſoeuer haue power to giue grace, and forgiue ſyns, (except in Baptiſme) by an externall ceremonie, muſt needs haue, and receaue that power in a Sacrament: (for ſuch extraordinarie guifts bee not giuen as Proteſtants confeſſe, by miracle: But preiſts as before, haue this power: Therefore <hi>Order</hi> and conſecration is a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Both propoſitions are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly true.</p>
               <p>Further I argue thus: whoſoeuer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that in conſecrateing preiſts, by impoſition of hands, by the Bishop, the holy ghoſt, grace, and power is giuen, to giue grace, and forgiue ſyns, muſt needs acknowledge <hi>Orders</hi> or ordination to bee a Sacrament: But the Proteſtants of England doe this: Therefore they muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Orders</hi> to bee a <hi>Sacrament</hi> in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.

               <p>Againe thus I argue: That externall viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ceremonie, by Impoſition of hands vppon ordinary men, whereby power is giuen them, aboue others from Chriſt, to tranſlate from darkenes into glorie, to make
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:26120:201"/> inuiſible grace of viſible Elements, daily to giue the holy Ghoſt, to diſpoſe of the flesh, and blood of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and giueth power which noe potentate on earthe, can giue, and the like prerogatiues, aboue all humane power, is to bee eſteemed a Sacrament: But (by theſe Proteſtants) <hi>Orders</hi> hath theſe, and ſuch more prerogatiues by Impoſing of hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore to bee eſteemed a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. The <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition is euidently true: for an externall ceremonie, giuing, and ſignifying ſuch power, grace, and priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that no terrene power, and authoritie can giue, muſt needs bee inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf, and ſo by that, which is proued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, bee allowed for a Sacrament.

                  <hi>which was giuen to them.</hi> From whence I argue further in this order.</p>
               <p>That externall and viſible Ceremonie, whereby the Apoſtles receaued ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grace, power, and preeminencie, and left it to the Church, to continue, beeing firſt inſtituted of Chriſt, is a Sacrament: But <hi>Orders</hi> is ſuch: Therefore a Sacrament.

                  <hi>and Orders, a Character is impreſſed in the ſoule, that is, a certaine ſpirituall and indeleble ſigne, that they may not bee iterated.</hi> For proofe of which doctrine, by English <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I argue in this Maner.</p>
               <p>That doctrine, which is taught by the Greeke Church, neither hereticall, nor Sciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, but orthodoxe by theſe Proteſtants, ot by a <hi>generall Councell,</hi> whoſe decree, and ſentence bindeth all, is to bee allowed by them, much more, if both thoſe their Rules ſo confirme it: But the doctrine of this <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leble character,</hi> in the Sacraments of <hi>Baptiſme, Confirmation,</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> is taught and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued both by the Greeke Church, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:26120:205"/> Councell, that of <hi>Florence,</hi> for ſuch allowed by them before: Therefore it ought to bee embraced by them. The <hi>Maior</hi> is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true, by their graunt before. And the <hi>Minor</hi> thus proued. Firſt the Greeke Church, by <hi>Hieremias</hi> their Patriarke, in their Cenſure <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hierem. in cenſur. cap.</hi> 11.</note> vppon <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in the eleuenth chapter, hath ſo cenſured. And the generall Councel of Florence, with the aſſert of the ſame Greeke Church, Armenians, Iacobines and all Chriſtendome hath defined it in theſe words: <hi>Inter haec Sacramenta, tria ſunt, Baptiſmus,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cil. Flor. in vnion. Arm.</note> 
                  <hi>Confirmatio, &amp; Ordo, quae Characterem. i. ſpirituale quoddam ſignum à caeteris diſtinctum, imprimunt in anima indelebile,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Among theſe Sacraments, there are three, Baptiſme, Confirmation, and Order, which impreſſe in the ſoule a Character, that is, a certaine ſpirituall ſigne, diſtinct from others indeleble: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon they are not Iterated in the ſame parſon, but the other fowre do not Impreſſe a Character, and admitt Iteration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To bee breife, I argue thus once for all. That doctrine, which is generally maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not onely by all profeſſors of it, but alſo acknowledged, and defended by them, that bee eſteemed learned among the enemies thereof, and profeſſe the ſame Religion with them, is true: But this doctrine of a <hi>Character</hi> is ſuch: Therefore it is true. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euidently appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for no more then frends, and Aduerſaries learned, can conſent to any truth. The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proued, by theſe Proteſtant Doctors, following, Ioyning in

I call it indeleble, becauſe they which haue once receiued this power, may not thinke to putt it of and on, like a cloake, as the wether ſerueth.</hi> And againe in this maner. <hi>Where there is a chaunge of eſtate, with an</hi>

                  <hi>Impoſsibilitie to returne, there wee haue reaſon to account an Indeleble Character, to bee imprinted. This ſaith the Church of Rome, is in Baptiſme, Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Order, This forme, figure, or Character is called Indeleble, becauſe that is not to bee reiterated</hi> (as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> confeſſe of <hi>Baptiſme, Confirmation</hi> and <hi>Orders) from whence it cometh. The Character of Order is an actiue power, as the ſchoolemen ſpeake, which giueth an Abilitie, publickly to adminiſter the Sacraments, vnto thoſe, whome the Church hath eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fitt. The Character of Baptiſme, is a paſſiue power, which maketh men fitt, to receaue the reſt.</hi> And from hence, not onely is proued in as playne words, as any ſchooleman, or other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke can ſpeake, the Catholicke opinion of
